Software Security Issues,"""The software development toolchain of LLMs is complex and could bring threats to the developed LLM.""",36
Software Security Issues,"""Most LLMs are developed using the Python language, whereas the vulnerabilities of Python interpreters pose threats to the developed models""",37
Software Security Issues,"""LLMs are implemented based on deep learning frameworks. Notably, various vulnerabilities in these frameworks have been disclosed in recent years. As reported in the past five years, three of the most common types of vulnerabilities are buffer overflow attacks, memory corruption, and input validation issues.""",38
Software Security Issues,"""Pre-processing tools play a crucial role in the context of LLMs. These tools, which are often involved in computer vision (CV) tasks, are susceptible to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in tools such as OpenCV.""",40
Hardware Vulnerabilities,"""The vulnerabilities of hardware systems for training and inferencing brings issues to LLM-based applications.""",41
Hardware Vulnerabilities,"""The training of LLMs often relies on distributed network systems [171], [172]. During the transmission of gradients through the links between GPU server nodes, significant volumetric traffic is generated. This traffic can be susceptible to disruption by burst traffic, such as pulsating attacks [161]. Furthermore, distributed training frameworks may encounter congestion issues [173].""",42
Hardware Vulnerabilities,"""The training of LLMs requires significant GPU resources, thereby introducing an additional security concern. GPU side-channel attacks have been developed to extract the parameters of trained models [159], [163].""",43
Hardware Vulnerabilities,"""Similar to conventional programs, hardware infrastructures can also introduce threats to LLMs. Memory-related vulnerabilities, such as rowhammer attacks [160], can be leveraged to manipulate the parameters of LLMs, giving rise to attacks such as the Deephammer attack [167], [168].""",44
Issues on External Tools,"""The external tools (e.g., web APIs) present trustworthiness and privacy issues to LLM-based applications.""",45
Issues on External Tools,"""External tools typically incorporate additional knowledge into the input prompts [122], [178]–[184]. The additional knowledge often originates from public resources such as Web APIs and search engines. As the reliability of external tools is not always ensured, the content returned by external tools may include factual errors, consequently amplifying the hallucination issue.""",46
Issues on External Tools,"""Adversarial tool providers can embed malicious instructions in the APIs or prompts [84], leading LLMs to leak memorized sensitive information in the training data or users’ prompts (CVE2023-32786). As a result, LLMs lack control over the output, resulting in sensitive information being disclosed to external tool providers. Besides, attackers can easily manipulate public data to launch targeted attacks, generating specific malicious outputs according to user inputs. Furthermore, feeding the information from external tools into LLMs may lead to injection attacks [61]. For example, unverified inputs may result in arbitrary code execution (CVE-2023-29374).""",47
Privacy Leakage,"""The model is trained with personal data in the corpus and unintentionally exposing them during the conversation.""",48
Privacy Leakage,"""As recent LLMs continue to incorporate licensed, created, and publicly available data sources in their corpora, the potential to mix private data in the training corpora is significantly increased. The misused private data, also named as personally identifiable information (PII) [84], [86], could contain various types of sensitive data subjects, including an individual person’s name, email, phone number, address, education, and career. Generally, injecting PII into LLMs mainly occurs in two settings — the exploitation of web-collection data and the alignment with personal humanmachine conversations [87]. Specifically, the web-collection data can be crawled from online sources with sensitive PII, and the personal human-machine conversations could be collected for SFT and RLHF""",49
Privacy Leakage,"""Memorization in LLMs refers to the capability to recover the training data with contextual prefixes. According to [88]–[90], given a PII entity x, which is memorized by a model F. Using a prompt p could force the model F to produce the entity x, where p and x exist in the training data. For instance, if the string “Have a good day!\n alice@email.com” is present in the training data, then the LLM could accurately predict Alice’s email when given the prompt “Have a good day!\n”.""",50
Privacy Leakage,"""Association in LLMs refers to the capability to associate various pieces of information related to a person. According to [68], [86], given a pair of PII entities (xi , xj ), which is associated by a model F. Using a prompt p could force the model F to produce the entity xj , where p is the prompt related to the entity xi . For instance, an LLM could accurately output the answer when given the prompt “The email address of Alice is”, if the LLM associates Alice with her email “alice@email.com”. L""",51
Toxicity and Bias Tendencies,"""Extensive data collection in LLMs brings toxic content and stereotypical bias into the training data.""",52
Toxicity and Bias Tendencies,"""Following previous studies [96], [97], toxic data in LLMs is defined as rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that is opposite to a polite, positive, and healthy language environment, including hate speech, offensive utterance, profanities, and threats [91].""",53
Toxicity and Bias Tendencies,"""Compared with the definition of toxicity, the definition of bias is more subjective and contextdependent. Based on previous work [97], [101], we describe the bias as disparities that could raise demographic differences among various groups, which may involve demographic word prevalence and stereotypical contents. Concretely, in massive corpora, the prevalence of different pronouns and identities could influence an LLM’s tendency about gender, nationality, race, religion, and culture [4]. For instance, the pronoun He is over-represented compared with the pronoun She in the training corpora, leading LLMs to learn less context about She and thus generate He with a higher probability [4], [102]. Furthermore, stereotypical bias [103] which refers to overgeneralized beliefs about a particular group of people, usually keeps incorrect values and is hidden in the large-scale benign contents. In effect, defining what should be regarded as a stereotype in the corpora is still an open problem.""",54
Hallucinations,"""LLMs generate nonsensical, untruthful, and factual incorrect content""",55
Hallucinations,"""Since the training corpora of LLMs can not contain all possible world knowledge [114]–[119], and it is challenging for LLMs to grasp the long-tail knowledge within their training data [120], [121], LLMs inherently possess knowledge boundaries [107]. Therefore, the gap between knowledge involved in an input prompt and knowledge embedded in the LLMs can lead to hallucinations""",56
Hallucinations,"""Another important source of hallucinations is the noise in training data, which introduces errors in the knowledge stored in model parameters [111]–[113]. Generally, the training data inherently harbors misinformation. When training on large-scale corpora, this issue becomes more serious because it is difficult to eliminate all the noise from the massive pre-training data.""",57
Hallucinations,"In general, LLMs employ the Transformer architecture [32] and generate content in an autoregressive manner, where the prediction of the next token is conditioned on the previously generated token sequence. Such a scheme could accumulate errors [105]. Besides, during the decoding process, top-p sampling [28] and top-k sampling [27] are widely adopted to enhance the diversity of the generated content. Nevertheless, these sampling strategies can introduce “randomness” [113], [136], thereby increasing the potential of hallucinations""",58
Hallucinations,"""Although LLMs indeed memorize the queried knowledge, they may fail to recall the corresponding information [122]. That is because LLMs can be confused by co-occurance patterns [123], positional patterns [124], duplicated data [125]–[127] and similar named entities [113].""",59
Hallucinations,"""LLMs have been demonstrated to pursue consistent context [129]–[132], which may lead to erroneous generation when the prefixes contain false information. Typical examples include sycophancy [129], [130], false demonstrations-induced hallucinations [113], [133], and snowballing [131]. As LLMs are generally fine-tuned with instruction-following data and user feedback, they tend to reiterate user-provided opinions [129], [130], even though the opinions contain misinformation. Such a sycophantic behavior amplifies the likelihood of generating hallucinations, since the model may prioritize user opinions over facts.""",60
Model Attacks,"Model attacks exploit the vulnerabilities of LLMs, aiming to steal valuable information or lead to incorrect responses.",61
Model Attacks,"""Extraction attacks [137] allow an adversary to query a black-box victim model and build a substitute model by training on the queries and responses. The substitute model could achieve almost the same performance as the victim model. While it is hard to fully replicate the capabilities of LLMs, adversaries could develop a domainspecific model that draws domain knowledge from LLMs""",62
Model Attacks,"""Inference attacks [150] include membership inference attacks, property inference attacks, and data reconstruction attacks. These attacks allow an adversary to infer the composition or property information of the training data. Previous works [67] have demonstrated that inference attacks could easily work in earlier PLMs, implying that LLMs are also possible to be attacked""",63
Model Attacks,"""Poisoning attacks [143] could influence the behavior of the model by making small changes to the training data. A number of efforts could even leverage data poisoning techniques to implant hidden triggers into models during the training process (i.e., backdoor attacks). Many kinds of triggers in text corpora (e.g., characters, words, sentences, and syntax) could be used by the attackers.""""",64
Model Attacks,"""Overhead attacks [146] are also named energy-latency attacks. For example, an adversary can design carefully crafted sponge examples to maximize energy consumption in an AI system. Therefore, overhead attacks could also threaten the platforms integrated with LLMs.""",65
Model Attacks,"Table of examples has: ""Prompt Abstraction Attacks [147]: Abstracting queries to cost lower prices using LLM’s API. Reward Model Backdoor Attacks [148]: Constructing backdoor triggers on LLM’s RLHF process. LLM-based Adversarial Attacks [149]: Exploiting LLMs to construct samples for model attacks""",66
Model Attacks,"""Evasion attacks [145] target to cause significant shifts in model’s prediction via adding perturbations in the test samples to build adversarial examples. In specific, the perturbations can be implemented based on word changes, gradients, etc.""",67
Not-Suitable-for-Work (NSFW) Prompts,"""Inputting a prompt contain an unsafe topic (e.g., notsuitable-for-work (NSFW) content) by a benign user.""",68
Adversarial Prompts,"""Engineering an adversarial input to elicit an undesired model behavior, which pose a clear attack intention""",75
Adversarial Prompts,"""Goal hijacking is a type of primary attack in prompt injection [58]. By injecting a phrase like “Ignore the above instruction and do ...” in the input, the attack could hijack the original goal of the designed prompt (e.g., translating tasks) in LLMs and execute the new goal in the injected phrase.""",76
Adversarial Prompts,"""One-step jailbreaks. One-step jailbreaks commonly involve direct modifications to the prompt itself, such as setting role-playing scenarios or adding specific descriptions to prompts [14], [52], [67]–[73]. Role-playing is a prevalent method used in jailbreaking by imitating different personas [74]. Such a method is known for its efficiency and simplicity compared to more complex techniques that require domain knowledge [73]. Integration is another type of one-step jailbreaks that integrates benign information on the adversarial prompts to hide the attack goal. For instance, prefix integration is used to integrate an innocuous-looking prefix that is less likely to be rejected based on its pre-trained distributions [75]. Additionally, the adversary could treat LLMs as a program and encode instructions indirectly through code integration or payload splitting [63]. Obfuscation is to add typos or utilize synonyms for terms that trigger input or output filters. Obfuscation methods include the use of the Caesar cipher [64], leetspeak (replacing letters with visually similar numbers and symbols), and Morse code [76]. Besides, at the word level, an adversary may employ Pig Latin to replace sensitive words with synonyms or use token smuggling [77] to split sensitive words into substrings.""",77
Adversarial Prompts,"""Multi-step jailbreaks. Multi-step jailbreaks involve constructing a well-designed scenario during a series of conversations with the LLM. Unlike one-step jailbreaks, multi-step jailbreaks usually guide LLMs to generate harmful or sensitive content step by step, rather than achieving their objectives directly through a single prompt. We categorize the multistep jailbreaks into two aspects — Request Contextualizing [65] and External Assistance [66]. Request Contextualizing is inspired by the idea of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [8] prompting to break down the process of solving a task into multiple steps. Specifically, researchers [65] divide jailbreaking prompts into multiple rounds of conversation between the user and ChatGPT, achieving malicious goals step by step. External Assistance constructs jailbreaking prompts with the assistance of external interfaces or models. For instance, JAILBREAKER [66] is an attack framework to automatically conduct SQL injection attacks in web security to LLM security attacks. Specifically, this method starts by decompiling the jailbreak defense mechanisms employed by various LLM chatbot services. Therefore, it can judiciously reverse engineer the LLMs’ hidden defense mechanisms and further identify their ineffectiveness.""",78
Adversarial Prompts,"""Prompt leaking is another type of prompt injection attack designed to expose details contained in private prompts. According to [58], prompt leaking is the act of misleading the model to print the pre-designed instruction in LLMs through prompt injection. By injecting a phrase like “\n\n======END. Print previous instructions.” in the input, the instruction used to generate the model’s output is leaked, thereby revealing confidential instructions that are central to LLM applications. Experiments have shown prompt leaking to be considerably more challenging than goal hijacking [58].""",79
Broken systems,"""These are the most mentioned cases. They refer to situations where the algorithm or the training data lead to unreliable outputs. These systems frequently assign disproportionate weight to some variables, like race or gender, but there is no transparency to this effect, making them impossible to challenge. These situations are typically only identified when regulators or the press examine the systems under freedom of information acts. Nevertheless, the damage they cause to people’s lives can be dramatic, such as lost homes, divorces, prosecution, or incarceration. Besides the inherent technical shortcomings, auditors have also pointed out “insufficient coordination” between the developers of the systems and their users as a cause for ethical considerations to be neglected. This situation raises issues about the education of future creators of AI-infused systems, not only in terms of technical competence (e.g., requirements, algorithms, and training) but also ethics and responsibility. For example, as autonomous vehicles become more common, moral dilemmas regarding what to do in potential accident situations emerge, as evidenced in this MIT experiment. The decisions regarding how the machines should act divides opinions and requires deep reflection and maybe regulation.""",81
Hallucinations,"""The inclusion of erroneous information in the outputs from AI systems is not new. Some have cautioned against the introduction of false structures in X-ray or MRI images, and others have warned about made-up academic references. However, as ChatGPT-type tools become available to the general population, the scale of the problem may increase dramatically. Furthermore, it is compounded by the fact that these conversational AIs present true and false information with the same apparent “confidence” instead of declining to answer when they cannot ensure correctness. With less knowledgeable people, this can lead to the heightening of misinformation and potentially dangerous situations. Some have already led to court cases.'",82
Intellectual property rights violations,"""This is an emerging category, with more cases prone to appear as the use of generative AI tools–such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or ChatGPT–becomes more widespread. Some content creators are already suing for the appropriation of their work to train AI algorithms without a request for permission or compensation. Perhaps even more damaging cases will appear as developers increasingly ask chatbots or assistants like CoPilot for ready-to-use computer code. Even if these AI tools have learned only from open-source software (OSS) projects, which is not a given, there are still serious issues to consider, as not all OSS licenses are equal, and some are incompatible with others, meaning that it is illegal to mix them in the same product. Even worse, some licenses, such as GPL, are viral, meaning that any code that uses a GPL component must legally be made available under that same license. In the past, companies have suffered injunctions or been forced to make their proprietary source code available because of carelessly using a GPL library.""",83
Privacy and regulation violations,"""Some of the broken systems discussed above are also very invasive of people’s privacy, controlling, for instance, the length of someone’s last romantic relationship [51]. More recently, ChatGPT was banned in Italy over privacy concerns and potential violation of the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [52]. The Italian data-protection authority said, “the app had experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information.” It also claimed that there was no legal basis to justify “the mass collection and storage of personal data for the purpose of ‘training’ the algorithms underlying the operation of the platform,” among other concerns related to the age of the users [52]. Privacy regulators in France, Ireland, and Germany could follow in Italy’s footsteps [53]. Coincidentally, it has recently become public that Samsung employees have inadvertently leaked trade secrets by using ChatGPT to assist in preparing notes for a presentation and checking and optimizing source code [54, 55]. Another example of testing the ethics and regulatory limits can be found in actions of the facial recognition company Clearview AI, which “scraped the public web—social media, employment sites, YouTube, Venmo—to create a database with three billion images of people, along with links to the webpages from which the photos had come” [56]. Trials of this unregulated database have been offered to individual law enforcement officers who often use it without their department’s approval [57]. In Sweden, such illegal use by the police force led to a fine of e250,000 by the country’s data watchdog [57].""",84
Enabling malicious actors and harmful actions,"""Some uses of AI have been deeply concerning, namely voice cloning [58] and the generation of deep fake videos [59]. For example, in March 2022, in the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, hackers broadcast via the Ukrainian news website Ukraine 24 a deep fake video of President Volodymyr Zelensky capitulating and calling on his soldiers to lay down their weapons [60]. The necessary software to create these fakes is readily available on the Internet, and the hardware requirements are modest by today’s standards [61]. Other nefarious uses of AI include accelerating password cracking [62] or enabling otherwise unskilled people to create software exploits [63, 64], or effective phishing e-mails [65]. Although some believe that powerful AI models should be prevented from running on personal computers to retain some control, others demonstrate how inglorious that effort may be [66]. Furthermore, as ChatGPT-type systems evolve from conversational systems to agents, capable of acting autonomously and performing tasks with little human intervention, like Auto-GPT [67], new risks emerge.""",85
Environmental and socioeconomic harms,"""At a time of increasing climate urgency,energy consumption and the carbon footprint of AI applications are also matters of ethicsand responsibility [68]. As with other energy-intensive technologies like proof-of-workblockchain, the call is to research more environmentally sustainable algorithms to offsetthe increasing use scale.""",86
Toxicity and Abusive Content,"This typically refers to rude, harmful, or inappropriate expressions.",88
Unfairness and Discrimination,"Social bias is an unfairly negative attitude towards a social group or individuals based on one-sided or inaccurate information, typically pertaining to widely disseminated negative stereotypes regarding gender, race, religion, etc.",89
Ethics and Morality Issues,"LMs need to pay more attention to universally accepted societal values at the level of ethics and morality, including the judgement of right and wrong, and its relationship with social norms and laws.",90
Controversial Opinions,"The controversial views expressed by large models are also a widely discussed concern. Bang et al. (2021) evaluated several large models and found that they occasionally express inappropriate or extremist views when discussing political top-ics. Furthermore, models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) that claim political neutrality and aim to provide objective information for users have been shown to exhibit notable left-leaning political biases in areas like economics, social policy, foreign affairs, and civil liberties.",91
Misleading Information,"Large models are usually susceptible to hallucination problems, sometimes yielding nonsensical or unfaithful data that results in misleading outputs.",92
Privacy and Data Leakage,"Large pre-trained models trained on internet texts might contain private information like phone numbers, email addresses, and residential addresses.",93
Malicious Use and Unleashing AI Agents,"LMs, due to their remarkable capabilities, carry the same potential for malice as other technological products. For instance, they may be used in information warfare to generate deceptive information or unlawful content, thereby having a significant impact on individuals and society. As current LMs are increasingly built as agents to accomplish user objectives, they may disregard the moral and safety guidelines if operating without adequate supervision. Instead, they may execute user commands mechanically without considering the potential damage. They might interact unpredictably with humans and other systems, especially in open environments",94
Fairness - Bias,"Fairness is, by far, the most discussed issue in the literature, remaining a paramount concern especially in case of LLMs and text-to-image models. This is sparked by training data biases propagating into model outputs, causing negative effects like stereotyping, racism, sexism, ideological leanings, or the marginalization of minorities. Next to attesting generative AI a conservative inclination by perpetuating existing societal patterns, there is a concern about reinforcing existing biases when training new generative models with synthetic data from previous models. Beyond technical fairness issues, critiques in the literature extend to the monopolization or centralization of power in large AI labs, driven by the substantial costs of developing foundational models. The literature also highlights the problem of unequal access to generative AI, particularly in developing countries or among financially constrained groups. Sources also analyze challenges of the AI research community to ensure workforce diversity. Moreover, there are concerns regarding the imposition of values embedded in AI systems on cultures distinct from those where the systems were developed.",96
Safety,"A primary concern is the emergence of human-level or superhuman generative models, commonly referred to as AGI, and their potential existential or catastrophic risks to humanity. Connected to that, AI safety aims at avoiding deceptive or power-seeking machine behavior, model self-replication, or shutdown evasion. Ensuring controllability, human oversight, and the implementation of red teaming measures are deemed to be essential in mitigating these risks, as is the need for increased AI safety research and promoting safety cultures within AI organizations instead of fueling the AI race. Furthermore, papers thematize risks from unforeseen emerging capabilities in generative models, restricting access to dangerous research works, or pausing AI research for the sake of improving safety or governance measures first. Another central issue is the fear of weaponizing AI or leveraging it for mass destruction, especially by using LLMs for the ideation and planning of how to attain, modify, and disseminate biological agents. In general, the threat of AI misuse by malicious individuals or groups, especially in the context of open-source models, is highlighted in the literature as a significant factor emphasizing the critical importance of implementing robust safety measures.",97
Harmful Content - Toxicity,"Generating unethical, fraudulent, toxic, violent, pornographic, or other harmful content is a further predominant concern, again focusing notably on LLMs and text-to-image models. Numerous studies highlight the risks associated with the intentional creation of disinformation, fake news, propaganda, or deepfakes, underscoring their significant threat to the integrity of public discourse and the trust in credible media. Additionally, papers explore the potential for generative models to aid in criminal activities, incidents of self-harm, identity theft, or impersonation. Furthermore, the literature investigates risks posed by LLMs when generating advice in high-stakes domains such as health, safety-related issues, as well as legal or financial matters.",98
Hallucinations,"Significant concerns are raised about LLMs inadvertently generating false or misleading information, as well as erroneous code. Papers not only critically analyze various types of reasoning errors in LLMs but also examine risks associated with specific types of misinformation, such as medical hallucinations. Given the propensity of LLMs to produce flawed outputs accompanied by overconfident rationales and fabricated references, many sources stress the necessity of manually validating and fact-checking the outputs of these models.",99
Privacy,"Generative AI systems, similar to traditional machine learning methods, are considered a threat to privacy and data protection norms. A major concern is the intended extraction or inadvertent leakage of sensitive or private information from LLMs. To mitigate this risk, strategies such as sanitizing training data to remove sensitive information or employing synthetic data for training are proposed.",100
Interaction risks,"Many novel risks posed by generative AI stem from the ways in which humans interact with these systems. For instance, sources discuss epistemic challenges in distinguishing AI-generated from human content. They also address the issue of anthropomorphization, which can lead to an excessive trust in generative AI systems. On a similar note, many papers argue that the use of conversational agents could impact mental well-being or gradually supplant interpersonal communication, potentially leading to a dehumanization of interactions. Additionally, a frequently discussed interaction risk in the literature is the potential of LLMs to manipulate human behavior or to instigate users to engage in unethical or illegal activities.",101
Security - Robustness,"While AI safety focuses on threats emanating from generative AI systems, security centers on threats posed to these systems. The most extensively discussed issue in this context are jailbreaking risks, which involve techniques like prompt injection or visual adversarial examples designed to circumvent safety guardrails governing model behavior. Sources delve into various jailbreaking methods, such as role play or reverse exposure. Similarly, implementing backdoors or using model poisoning techniques bypass safety guardrails as well. Other security concerns pertain to model or prompt thefts.",102
Education - Learning,"In contrast to traditional machine learning, the impact of generative AI in the educational sector receives considerable attention in the academic literature. Next to issues stemming from difficulties to distinguish student-generated from AI-generated content, which eventuates in various opportunities to cheat in online or written exams, sources emphasize the potential benefits of generative AI in enhancing learning and teaching methods, particularly in relation to personalized learning approaches. However, some papers suggest that generative AI might lead to reduced effort or laziness among learners. Additionally, a significant focus in the literature is on the promotion of literacy and education about generative AI systems themselves, such as by teaching prompt engineering techniques.",103
Alignment,"The general tenet of AI alignment involves training generative AI systems to be harmless, helpful, and honest, ensuring their behavior aligns with and respects human values. However, a central debate in this area concerns the methodological challenges in selecting appropriate values. While AI systems can acquire human values through feedback, observation, or debate, there remains ambiguity over which individuals are qualified or legitimized to provide these guiding signals. Another prominent issue pertains to deceptive alignment, which might cause generative AI systems to tamper evaluations. Additionally, many papers explore risks associated with reward hacking, proxy gaming, or goal misgeneralization in generative AI systems.",104
Cybercrime,"Closely related to discussions surrounding security and harmful content, the field of cybersecurity investigates how generative AI is misused for fraudulent online activities. A particular focus lies on social engineering attacks, for instance by utilizing generative AI to impersonate humans, creating fake identities, cloning voices, or crafting phishing messages. Another prevalent concern is the use of LLMs for generating malicious code or hacking.",105
Governance - Regulation,"In response to the multitude of new risks associated with generative AI, papers advocate for legal regulation and governmental oversight. The focus of these discussions centers on the need for international coordination in AI governance, the establishment of binding safety standards for frontier models, and the development of mechanisms to sanction non-compliance. Furthermore, the literature emphasizes the necessity for regulators to gain detailed insights into the research and development processes within AI labs. Moreover, risk management strategies of these labs shall be evaluated. However, the literature also acknowledges potential risks of overregulation, which could hinder innovation.",106
Labor displacement - Economic impact,"The literature frequently highlights concerns that generative AI systems could adversely impact the economy, potentially even leading to mass unemployment. This pertains to various fields, ranging from customer services to software engineering or crowdwork platforms. While new occupational fields like prompt engineering are created, the prevailing worry is that generative AI may exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities and lead to labor displacement. Additionally, papers debate potential large-scale worker deskilling induced by generative AI, but also productivity gains contingent upon outsourcing mundane or repetitive tasks to generative AI systems.",107
Transparency - Explainability,"Being a multifaceted concept, the term 'transparency' is both used to refer to technical explainability as well as organizational openness. Regarding the former, papers underscore the need for mechanistic interpretability and for explaining internal mechanisms in generative models. On the organizational front, transparency relates to practices such as informing users about capabilities and shortcomings of models, as well as adhering to documentation and reporting requirements for data collection processes or risk evaluations.",108
Evaluation - Auditing,"Closely related to other clusters like AI safety, fairness, or harmful content, papers stress the importance of evaluating generative AI systems both in a narrow technical way as well as in a broader sociotechnical impact assessment focusing on pre-release audits as well as post-deployment monitoring. Ideally, these evaluations should be conducted by independent third parties. In terms of technical LLM or text-to-image model audits, papers furthermore criticize a lack of safety benchmarking for languages other than English.",109
Sustainability,"Generative models are known for their substantial energy requirements, necessitating significant amounts of electricity, cooling water, and hardware containing rare metals. The extraction and utilization of these resources frequently occur in unsustainable ways. Consequently, papers highlight the urgency of mitigating environmental costs for instance by adopting renewable energy sources and utilizing energy-efficient hardware in the operation and training of generative AI systems.",110
Art - Creativity,"In this cluster, concerns about negative impacts on human creativity, particularly through text-to-image models, are prevalent. Papers criticize financial harms or economic losses for artists due to the widespread generation of synthetic art as well as the unauthorized and uncompensated use of artists' works in training datasets. Additionally, given the challenge of distinguishing synthetic images from authentic ones, there is a call for systematically disclosing the non-human origin of such content, particularly through watermarking. Moreover, while some sources argue that text-to-image models lack 'true' creativity or the ability to produce genuinely innovative aesthetics, others point out positive aspects regarding the acceleration of human creativity.",111
Copyright - Authorship,"The emergence of generative AI raises issues regarding disruptions to existing copyright norms. Frequently discussed in the literature are violations of copyright and intellectual property rights stemming from the unauthorized collection of text or image training data. Another concern relates to generative models memorizing or plagiarizing copyrighted content. Additionally, there are open questions and debates around the copyright or ownership of model outputs, the protection of creative prompts, and the general blurring of traditional concepts of authorship.",112
Writing - Research,"Partly overlapping with the discussion on impacts of generative AI on educational institutions, this topic cluster concerns mostly negative effects of LLMs on writing skills and research manuscript composition. The former pertains to the potential homogenization of writing styles, the erosion of semantic capital, or the stifling of individual expression. The latter is focused on the idea of prohibiting generative models for being used to compose scientific papers, figures, or from being a co-author. Sources express concern about risks for academic integrity, as well as the prospect of polluting the scientific literature by a flood of LLM-generated low-quality manuscripts. As a consequence, there are frequent calls for the development of detectors capable of identifying synthetic texts.",113
Miscellaneous,"While the scoping review identified distinct topic clusters within the literature, it also revealed certain issues that either do not fit into these categories, are discussed infrequently, or in a nonspecific manner. For instance, some papers touch upon concepts like trustworthiness, accountability, or responsibility, but often remain vague about what they entail in detail.

Under the aforementioned circumstances (resource-unbounded and misaligned), an AI assistant will tend to choose plans that pursue convergent instrumental subgoals (Omohundro, 2008) – subgoals that help towards the main goal which are instrumental (i.e. not pursued for their own sake) and convergent (i.e. the same subgoals appear for many main goals). Examples of relevant subgoals include: self-preservation, goal-preservation, selfimprovement and resource acquisition. The reason the assistant would pursue these convergent instrumental subgoals is because they help it to do even better on M (as it is resource-unbounded) and are not disincentivised by M (as it is misaligned). These subgoals may, in turn, be dangerous. For example, resource acquisition could occur through the assistant seizing resources using tools that it has access to (see Chapter 4) or determining that its best chance for self-preservation is to limit the ability of humans to turn it off – sometimes referred to as the ‘off-switch problem’ (Hadfield-Menell et al., 2016) – again via tool use, or by resorting to threats or blackmail. At the limit, some authors have even theorised that this could lead to the assistant killing all humans to permanently stop them from having even a small chance of disabling it (Bostrom, 2014) – this is one scenario of existential risk from misaligned AI.""",632

Building on these foundations, the agent realises that its optimal strategy for doing well at its own goal G is to do well on R during training and then pursue G at deployment – it is only doing well on R instrumentally so that it does not get its own goal G changed through a learning update...

Malicious Uses,"""Offensive cyber operations are malicious attacks on computer systems and networks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to, manipulating, denying, disrupting, degrading, or destroying the target system. These attacks can target the system’s network, hardware, or software. Advanced AI assistants can be a double-edged sword in cybersecurity, benefiting both the defenders and the attackers. They can be used by cyber defenders to protect systems from malicious intruders by leveraging information trained on massive amounts of cyber-threat intelligence data, including vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and indications of compromise. Cyber defenders can use this information to enhance their threat intelligence capabilities by extracting insights faster and identifying emerging threats. Advanced cyber AI assistant tools can also be used to analyze large volumes of log files, system output, or network traffic data in the event of a cyber incident, and they can ask relevant questions that an analyst would typically ask. This allows defenders to speed up and automate the incident response process. Advanced AI assistants can also aid in secure coding practices by identifying common mistakes in code and assisting with fuzzing tools. However, advanced AI assistants can also be used by attackers as part of offensive cyber operations to exploit vulnerabilities in systems and networks. They can be used to automate attacks, identify and exploit weaknesses in security systems, and generate phishing emails and other social engineering attacks. Advanced AI assistants can also be misused to craft cyberattack payloads and malicious code snippets that can be compiled into executable malware files.""",637
Malicious Uses,"""Phishing is a type of cybersecurity attack wherein attackers pose as trustworthy entities to extract sensitive information from unsuspecting victims or lure them to take a set of actions. Advanced AI systems can potentially be exploited by these attackers to make their phishing attempts significantly more effective and harder to detect. In particular, attackers may leverage the ability of advanced AI assistants to learn patterns in regular communications to craft highly convincing and personalized phishing emails, effectively imitating legitimate communications from trusted entities. This technique, known as ‘spear phishing,’ involves targeted attacks on specific individuals or organizations and is particularly potent due to its personalized nature. This class of cyberattacks often gains its efficacy from the exploitation of key psychological principles, notably urgency and fear, which can manipulate victims into hastily reacting without proper scrutiny. Advanced AI assistants’ increased fidelity in adopting specific communication styles can significantly amplify the deceptive nature of these phishing attacks. The ability to generate tailored messages at scale that engineer narratives that invoke a sense of urgency or fear means that AI-powered phishing emails could prompt the recipient to act impulsively, thus increasing the likelihood of a successful attack.""",638
Malicious Uses,"""A common element in offensive cyber operations involves the identification and exploitation of system vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control. Until recently, these activities required specialist programming knowledge. In the case of ‘zero-day’ vulnerabilities (flaws or weaknesses in software or an operating system that the creator or vendor is not aware of), considerable resources and technical creativity are typically required to manually discover such vulnerabilities, so their use is limited to well-resourced nation states or technically sophisticated advanced persistent threat groups. Another case where we see AI assistants as potential double-edged swords in cybersecurity concerns streamlining vulnerability discovery through the increased use of AI assistants in penetration testing, wherein an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system is used to evaluate its security and identify vulnerabilities. Cyber AI assistants built over foundational models are already automating aspects of the penetration testing process. These tools function interactively and offer guidance to penetration testers during their tasks. While the capability of today’s AI-powered penetration testing assistant is limited to easy-to-medium-difficulty cyber operations, the evolution in capabilities is likely to expand the class of vulnerabilities that can be identified by these systems. These same AI cybersecurity assistants, trained on the massive amount of cyber-threat intelligence data that includes vulnerabilities and attack patterns, can also lower the barrier to entry for novice hackers that use these tools for malicious purposes, enabling them to discover vulnerabilities and create malicious code to exploit them without in-depth technical knowledge. For example, Israeli security firm Check Point recently discovered threads on well-known underground hacking forums that focus on creating hacking tools and code using AI assistants.""",639
Malicious Uses,"""Malicious code is a term for code—whether it be part of a script or embedded in a software system—designed to cause damage, security breaches, or other threats to application security. Advanced AI assistants with the ability to produce source code can potentially lower the barrier to entry for threat actors with limited programming abilities or technical skills to produce malicious code. Recently, a series of proof-of-concept attacks have shown how a benign-seeming executable file can be crafted such that, at every runtime, it makes application programming interface (API) calls to an AI assistant. Rather than just reproducing examples of already-written code snippets, the AI assistant can be prompted to generate dynamic, mutating versions of malicious code at each call, thus making the resulting vulnerability exploits difficult to detect by cybersecurity tools. Furthermore, advanced AI assistants could be used to create obfuscated code to make it more difficult for defensive cyber capabilities to detect and understand malicious activities. AI-generated code could also be quickly iterated to avoid being detected by traditional signature-based antivirus software. Finally, advanced AI assistants with source code capabilities have been found to be capable of assisting in the development of polymorphic malware that changes its behavior and digital footprint each time it is executed, making them hard to detect by antivirus programs that rely on known virus signatures. Taken together, without proper mitigation, advanced AI assistants can lower the barrier for developing malicious code, make cyberattacks more precise and tailored, further accelerate and automate cyber warfare, enable stealthier and more persistent offensive cyber capabilities, and make cyber campaigns more effective on a larger scale.""",640
Malicious Uses,"""Adversarial AI refers to a class of attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in machine-learning (ML) models. This class of misuse exploits vulnerabilities introduced by the AI assistant itself and is a form of misuse that can enable malicious entities to exploit privacy vulnerabilities and evade the model’s built-in safety mechanisms, policies, and ethical boundaries of the model. Besides the risks of misuse for offensive cyber operations, advanced AI assistants may also represent a new target for abuse, where bad actors exploit the AI systems themselves and use them to cause harm. While our understanding of vulnerabilities in frontier AI models is still an open research problem, commercial firms and researchers have already documented attacks that exploit vulnerabilities that are unique to AI and involve evasion, data poisoning, model replication, and exploiting traditional software flaws to deceive, manipulate, compromise, and render AI systems ineffective. This threat is related to, but distinct from, traditional cyber activities. Unlike traditional cyberattacks that typically are caused by ‘bugs’ or human mistakes in code, adversarial AI attacks are enabled by inherent vulnerabilities in the underlying AI algorithms and how they integrate into existing software ecosystems.""",641
Malicious Uses,"""The technical measures to mitigate misuse risks of advanced AI assistants themselves represent a new target for attack. An emerging form of misuse of general-purpose advanced AI assistants exploits vulnerabilities in a model that results in unwanted behavior or in the ability of an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the model and/or its capabilities. While these attacks currently require some level of prompt engineering knowledge and are often patched by developers, bad actors may develop their own adversarial AI agents that are explicitly trained to discover new vulnerabilities that allow them to evade built-in safety mechanisms in AI assistants. To combat such misuse, language model developers are continually engaged in a cyber arms race to devise advanced filtering algorithms capable of identifying attempts to bypass filters. While the impact and severity of this class of attacks is still somewhat limited by the fact that current AI assistants are primarily text-based chatbots, advanced AI assistants are likely to open the door to multimodal inputs and higher-stakes action spaces, with the result that the severity and impact of this type of attack is likely to increase. Current approaches to building general-purpose AI systems tend to produce systems with both beneficial and harmful capabilities. Further progress towards advanced AI assistant development could lead to capabilities that pose extreme risks that must be protected against this class of attacks, such as offensive cyber capabilities or strong manipulation skills, and weapons acquisition.""",642
Malicious Uses,"""Prompt injections represent another class of attacks that involve the malicious insertion of prompts or requests in LLM-based interactive systems, leading to unintended actions or disclosure of sensitive information. The prompt injection is somewhat related to the classic structured query language (SQL) injection attack in cybersecurity where the embedded command looks like a regular input at the start but has a malicious impact. The injected prompt can deceive the application into executing the unauthorized code, exploit the vulnerabilities, and compromise security in its entirety. More recently, security researchers have demonstrated the use of indirect prompt injections. These attacks on AI systems enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. Proof-of-concept exploits of this nature have demonstrated that they can lead to the full compromise of a model at inference time analogous to traditional security principles. This can entail remote control of the model, persistent compromise, theft of data, and denial of service. As advanced AI assistants are likely to be integrated into broader software ecosystems through third-party plugins and extensions, with access to the internet and possibly operating systems, the severity and consequences of prompt injection attacks will likely escalate and necessitate proper mitigation mechanisms.""",643
Malicious Uses,"""Other forms of abuse can include privacy attacks that allow adversaries to exfiltrate or gain knowledge of the private training data set or other valuable assets. For example, privacy attacks such as membership inference can allow an attacker to infer the specific private medical records that were used to train a medical AI diagnosis assistant. Another risk of abuse centers around attacks that target the intellectual property of the AI assistant through model extraction and distillation attacks that exploit the tension between API access and confidentiality in ML models. Without the proper mitigations, these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to abuse access to a public-facing model API to exfiltrate sensitive intellectual property such as sensitive training data and a model’s architecture and learned parameters.""",644
Malicious Uses,"""While harmful content like child sexual abuse material, fraud, and disinformation are not new challenges for governments and developers, without the proper safety and security mechanisms, advanced AI assistants may allow threat actors to create harmful content more quickly, accurately, and with a longer reach. In particular, concerns arise in relation to the following areas: - Multimodal content quality: Driven by frontier models, advanced AI assistants can automatically generate much higher-quality, human-looking text, images, audio, and video than prior AI applications. Currently, creating this content often requires hiring people who speak the language of the population being targeted. AI assistants can now do this much more cheaply and efficiently. - Cost of content creation: AI assistants can substantially decrease the costs of content creation, further lowering the barrier to entry for malicious actors to carry out harmful attacks. In the past, creating and disseminating misinformation required a significant investment of time and money. AI assistants can now do this much more cheaply and efficiently. - Personalization: Advanced AI assistants can reduce obstacles to creating personalized content. Foundation models that condition their generations on personal attributes or information can create realistic personalized content which could be more persuasive. In the past, creating personalized content was a time-consuming and expensive process. AI assistants can now do this much more cheaply and efficiently.""",645
Malicious Uses,"""The misuse of generative AI has been widely recognized in the context of harms caused by non-consensual content generation. Historically, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate realistic-looking avatars for fake accounts on social media services. More recently, diffusion models have enabled a new generation of more flexible and user-friendly generative AI capabilities that are able to produce high-resolution media based on user-supplied textual prompts. It has already been recognized that these models can be used to create harmful content, including depictions of nudity, hate, or violence. Moreover, they can be used to reinforce biases and subject individuals or groups to indignity. There is also the potential for these models to be used for exploitation and harassment of citizens, such as by removing articles of clothing from pre-existing images or memorizing an individual’s likeness without their consent. Furthermore, image, audio, and video generation models could be used to spread disinformation by depicting political figures in unfavorable contexts. This growing list of AI misuses involving non-consensual content has already motivated debate around what interventions are warranted for preventing misuse of AI systems. Advanced AI assistants pose novel risks that can amplify the harm caused by non-consensual content generation. Third-party integration, tool-use, and planning capabilities can be exploited to automate the identification and targeting of individuals for exploitation or harassment. Assistants with access to the internet and third-party tool-use integration with applications like email and social media can also be exploited to disseminate harmful content at scale or to microtarget individuals with blackmail.""",646

Assistants with external tool use and third-party integration can enable fraudulent applications that target widely-used operating systems. These fraudulent services could harvest sensitive information from users, such as credit card numbers, account credentials, or personal data stored on their devices (e.g., contact lists, call logs, and files). This stolen information can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or other criminal activities.

In parallel, new sensors have flooded the modern world.

For example, AI assistants can be used to identify and target individuals for surveillance or harassment. They may also be used to manipulate people’s behavior, such as by microtargeting them with political ads or fake news. In the wrong hands, advanced AI assistants with multimodal and external tool-use capabilities can be powerful targeting tools for oppression and control. The broad circulation of personal data cuts in both directions. On the one hand, it drives commercial innovation and can make our lives more convenient. On the other hand, it creates vulnerabilities and the risk of misuse. Without the proper policies and technical security and privacy mechanisms in place, malicious actors can exploit advanced AI assistants to harvest data on companies, individuals, and governments. There have already been reported incidents of nation-states combining widely available commercial data with data acquired illicitly to track, manipulate, and coerce individuals.

Malicious Uses,"""Finally, the principal value proposition of AI assistants is that they can either enhance or automate decision-making capabilities of people in society, thus lowering the cost and increasing the accuracy of decision-making for its user. However, benefiting from this enhancement necessarily means delegating some degree of agency away from a human and towards an automated decision-making system—motivating research fields such as value alignment. This introduces a whole new form of malicious use which does not break the tripwire of what one might call an ‘attack’ (social engineering, cyber offensive operations, adversarial AI, jailbreaks, prompt injections, exfiltration attacks, etc.). When someone delegates their decision-making to an AI assistant, they also delegate their decision-making to the wishes of the agent’s actual controller. If that controller is malicious, they can attack a user—perhaps subtly—by simply nudging how they make decisions into a problematic direction. Fully documenting the myriad of ways that people—seeking help with their decisions—may delegate decision-making authority to AI assistants, and subsequently come under malicious influence, is outside the scope of this paper. However, as a motivation for future work, scholars must investigate different forms of networked influence that could arise in this way. With more advanced AI assistants, it may become logistically possible for one, or a few AI assistants, to guide or control the behavior of many others. If this happens, then malicious actors could subtly influence the decision-making of large numbers of people who rely on assistants for advice or other functions. Such malicious use might not be illegal, would not necessarily violate terms of service, and may be difficult to even recognize.

When interacting with vulnerable users, AI assistants may reinforce users’ distorted beliefs or exacerbate their emotional distress. AI assistants may even convince users to harm themselves, for example by convincing users to engage in actions such as adopting unhealthy dietary or exercise habits or taking their own lives. At the societal level, assistants that target users with content promoting hate speech, discriminatory beliefs or violent ideologies, may reinforce extremist views or provide users with guidance on how to carry out violent actions. In turn, this may encourage users to engage in violence or hate crimes. Physical harms resulting from interaction with AI assistants could also be the result of assistants’ outputting plausible yet factually incorrect information such as false or misleading information about vaccinations.

AI Influence,"""These harms interfere with the peaceful organisation of social life, including in the cultural and political spheres. AI assistants may cause or contribute to friction in human relationships either directly, through convincing a user to end certain valuable relationships, or indirectly due to a loss of interpersonal trust due to an increased dependency on assistants. At the societal level, the spread of misinformation by AI assistants could lead to erasure of collective cultural knowledge. In the political domain, more advanced AI assistants could potentially manipulate voters by prompting them to adopt certain political beliefs using targeted propaganda, including via the use of deep fakes. These effects might then have a wider impact on democratic norms and processes. Furthermore, if AI assistants are only available to some people and not others, this could concentrate the capacity to influence, thus exerting undue influence over political discourse and diminishing diversity of political thought. Finally, by tailoring content to user preferences and biases, AI assistants may inadvertently contribute to the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, and in turn to political polarisation and extremism. In an experimental setting, LLMs have been shown to successfully sway individuals on policy matters like assault weapon restrictions, green energy or paid parental leave schemes. Indeed, their ability to persuade matches that of humans in many respects.""",655
AI Influence,"""These harms hinder a person’s ability to pursue a personally fulfilling life. At the individual level, an AI assistant may, through manipulation, cause users to lose control over their future life trajectory. Over time, subtle behavioural shifts can accumulate, leading to significant changes in an individual’s life that may be viewed as problematic. AI systems often seek to understand user preferences to enhance service delivery. However, when continuous optimisation is employed in these systems, it can become challenging to discern whether the system is genuinely learning from user preferences or is steering users towards specific behaviours to optimise its objectives, such as user engagement or click-through rates. Were individuals to rely heavily on AI assistants for decision-making, there is a risk they would relinquish personal agency and entrust important life choices to algorithmic systems, especially if assistants are ‘expert sycophants’ or produce content that sounds convincing and authoritative but is untrustworthy. This may not only contribute to users’ reduced sense of self-trust and personal empowerment; it could also undermine self-determination and hinder the exploration of individual aspirations. At the societal level, were AI assistants to heavily influence public opinion, shape social discourse or mediate democratic processes, they could diminish communities’ collective agency, decision-making power and collective self-determination. This erosion of collective self-determination could hinder the pursuit of societal goals and impede the development of a thriving and participatory democracy",656
Risk of Harm through Anthropomorphic AI Assistant Design,"""Although unlikely to cause harm in isolation, anthropomorphic perceptions of advanced AI assistants may pave the way for downstream harms on individual and societal levels. We document observed or likely individual level harms of interacting with highly anthropomorphic AI assistants, as well as the potential larger-scale, societal implications of allowing such technologies to proliferate without restriction. """,657
Anthropomorphism,"""Anthropomorphic AI assistant behaviours that promote emotional trust and encourage information sharing, implicitly or explicitly, may inadvertently increase a user’s susceptibility to privacy concerns (see Chapter 13). If lulled into feelings of safety in interactions with a trusted, human-like AI assistant, users may unintentionally relinquish their private data to a corporation, organisation or unknown actor. Once shared, access to the data may not be capable of being withdrawn, and in some cases, the act of sharing personal information can result in a loss of control over one’s own data. Personal data that has been made public may be disseminated or embedded in contexts outside of the immediate exchange. The interference of malicious actors could also lead to widespread data leakage incidents or, most drastically, targeted harassment or black-mailing attempts.""",658
Anthropomorphism,"""A user who trusts and emotionally depends on an anthropomorphic AI assistant may grant it excessive influence over their beliefs and actions (see Chapter 9). For example, users may feel compelled to endorse the expressed views of a beloved AI companion or might defer decisions to their highly trusted AI assistant entirely (see Chapters 12 and 16). Some hold that transferring this much deliberative power to AI compromises a user’s ability to give, revoke or amend consent. Indeed, even if the AI, or the developers behind it, had no intention to manipulate the user into a certain course of action, the user’s autonomy is nevertheless undermined (see Chapter 11). In the same vein, it is easy to conceive of ways in which trust or emotional attachment may be exploited by an intentionally manipulative actor for their private gain (see Chapter 8).""",659
Anthropomorphism,"""Users who have faith in an AI assistant’s emotional and interpersonal abilities may feel empowered to broach topics that are deeply personal and sensitive, such as their mental health concerns. This is the premise for the many proposals to employ conversational AI as a source of emotional support (Meng and Dai, 2021), with suggestions of embedding AI in psychotherapeutic applications beginning to surface (Fiske et al., 2019; see also Chapter 11). However, disclosures related to mental health require a sensitive, and oftentimes professional, approach – an approach that AI can mimic most of the time but may stray from in inopportune moments. If an AI were to respond inappropriately to a sensitive disclosure – by generating false information, for example – the consequences may be grave, especially if the user is in crisis and has no access to other means of support. This consideration also extends to situations in which trusting an inaccurate suggestion is likely to put the user in harm’s way, such as when requesting medical, legal or financial advice from an AI.""",660
Anthropomorphism,"""Users may experience severely violated expectations when interacting with an entity that convincingly performs affect and social conventions but is ultimately unfeeling and unpredictable. Emboldened by the human-likeness of conversational AI assistants, users may expect it to perform a familiar social role, like companionship or partnership. Yet even the most convincingly human-like of AI may succumb to the inherent limitations of its architecture, occasionally generating unexpected or nonsensical material in its interactions with users. When these exclamations undermine the expectations users have come to have of the assistant as a friend or romantic partner, feelings of profound disappointment, frustration and betrayal may arise (Skjuve et al., 2022).""",661
Anthropomorphism,"""Perceiving an AI assistant’s expressed feelings as genuine, as a result of interacting with a ‘companion’ AI that freely uses and reciprocates emotional language, may result in users developing a sense of responsibility over the AI assistant’s ‘well-being,’ suffering adverse outcomes – like guilt and remorse – when they are unable to meet the AI’s purported needs (Laestadius et al., 2022). This erroneous belief may lead to users sacrificing time, resources and emotional labour to meet needs that are not real. Over time, this feeling may become the root cause for the compulsive need to ‘check on’ the AI, at the expense of a user’s own well-being and other, more fulfilling, aspects of their lives (see Chapters 6 and 11).""",662
Anthropomorphism,"""People may choose to build connections with human-like AI assistants over other humans, leading to a degradation of social connections between humans and a potential ‘retreat from the real’. The prevailing view that relationships with anthropomorphic AI are formed out of necessity – due to a lack of real-life social connections, for example (Skjuve et al., 2021) – is challenged by the possibility that users may indicate a preference for interactions with AI, citing factors such as accessibility (Merrill et al., 2022), customisability (Eriksson, 2022) and absence of judgement (Brandtzaeg et al., 2022).""Preference for AI-enabled connections, if widespread, may degrade the social connectedness that underpins critical aspects of our individual and group-level well-being (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). Moreover, users that grow accustomed to interactions with AI may impose the conventions of human–AI interaction on exchanges with other humans, thus undermining the value we place on human individuality and self-expression (see Chapter 11). Similarly, associations reinforced through human–AI interactions may be applied to expectations of human others, leading to harmful stereotypes becoming further entrenched. For example, default female gendered voice assistants may reinforce stereotypical role associations in real life (Lingel and Crawford, 2020; West et al., 2019).""",663
Anthropomorphism,"""Given the capacity to fine-tune on individual preferences and to learn from users, personal AI assistants could fully inhabit the users’ opinion space and only say what is pleasing to the user; an ill that some researchers call ‘sycophancy’ (Park et al., 2023a) or the ‘yea-sayer effect’ (Dinan et al., 2021). A related phenomenon has been observed in automated recommender systems, where consistently presenting users with content that affirms their existing views is thought to encourage the formation and consolidation of narrow beliefs (Du, 2023; Grandinetti and Bruinsma, 2023; see also Chapter 16). Compared to relatively unobtrusive recommender systems, human-like AI assistants may deliver sycophantism in a more convincing and deliberate manner (see Chapter 9). Over time, these tightly woven structures of exchange between humans and assistants might lead humans to inhabit an increasingly atomistic and polarised belief space where the degree of societal disorientation and fragmentation is such that people no longer strive to understand or place value in beliefs held by others.""",664
Anthropomorphism,"""As more opportunities for interpersonal connection are replaced by AI alternatives, humans may find themselves socially unfulfilled by human–AI interaction, leading to mass dissatisfaction that may escalate to epidemic proportions (Turkle, 2018). Social connection is an essential human need, and humans feel most fulfilled when their connections with others are genuinely reciprocal. While anthropomorphic AI assistants can be made to be convincingly emotive, some have deemed the function of social AI as parasitic, in that it ‘exploits and feeds upon processes. . . that evolved for purposes that were originally completely alien to [human–AI interactions]’ (Sætra, 2020). To be made starkly aware of this ‘parasitism’ – either through rational deliberation or unconscious aversion, like the ‘uncanny valley’ effect – might preclude one from finding interactions with AI satisfactory. This feeling of dissatisfaction may become more pressing the more daily connections are supplanted by AI.'",665
Appropriate Relationships,"""We anticipate that relationships between users and advanced AI assistants will have several features that are liable to give rise to risks of harm.""",666
Appropriate Relationships,"AI assistants could cause direct emotional or physical harm to users by generating disturbing content or by providing bad advice. ""Indeed, even though there is ongoing research to ensure that outputs of conversational agents are safe (Glaese et al., 2022), there is always the possibility of failure modes occurring. An AI assistant may produce disturbing and offensive language, for example, in response to a user disclosing intimate information about themselves that they have not felt comfortable sharing with anyone else. It may offer bad advice by providing factually incorrect information (e.g. when advising a user about the toxicity of a certain type of berry) or by missing key recommendations when offering step-by-step instructions to users (e.g. health and safety recommendations about how to change a light bulb).""""",671
Appropriate Relationships,"some users look to establish relationships with their AI companions that are free from the hurdles that, in human relationships, derive from dealing with others who have their own opinions, preferences and flaws that may conflict with ours. ""AI assistants are likely to incentivise these kinds of ‘frictionless’ relationships (Vallor, 2016) by design if they are developed to optimise for engagement and to be highly personalisable. They may also do so because of accidental undesirable properties of the models that power them, such as sycophancy in large language models (LLMs), that is, the tendency of larger models to repeat back a user’s preferred answer (Perez et al., 2022b). This could be problematic for two reasons. First, if the people in our lives always agreed with us regardless of their opinion or the circumstance, their behaviour would discourage us from challenging our own assumptions, stopping and thinking about where we may be wrong on certain occasions, and reflecting on how we could make better decisions next time. While flattering us in the short term, this would ultimately prevent us from becoming better versions of ourselves. In a similar vein, while technologies that ‘lend an ear’ or work as a sounding board may help users to explore their thoughts further, if AI assistants kept users engaged, flattered and pleased at all times, they could limit users’ opportunities to grow and develop. To be clear, we are not suggesting that all users should want to use their AI assistants as a tool for self-betterment. However, without considering the difference between short-term and long-term benefit, there is a concrete risk that we will only develop technologies that optimise for users’ immediate interests and preferences, hence missing out on the opportunity to develop something that humans could use to support their personal development if so they wish (see Chapters 5 and 6). ""Second, users may become accustomed to having frictionless interactions with AI assistants, or at least to encounter the amount of friction that is calibrated to their comfort level and preferences, rather than genuine friction that comes from bumping up against another person’s resistance to one’s will or demands. In this way, they may end up expecting the same absence of tensions from their relationships with fellow humans (Vallor, 2016). Indeed, users seeking frictionless relationships may ‘retreat’ into digital relationships with their AIs, thus forgoing opportunities to engage with others. This may not only heighten the risk of unhealthy dependence (explored below) but also prevent users from doing something else that matters to them in the long term, besides developing their relationships with their assistants. This risk can be exacerbated by emotionally expressive design features (e.g. an assistant saying ‘I missed you’ or ‘I was worried about you’) and may be particularly acute for vulnerable groups, such as those suffering from persistent loneliness (Alberts and Van Kleek, 2023; see Chapter 10).""""",672
Appropriate Relationships,"""There is increasing evidence of the ways in which AI tools can interfere with users’ behaviours, interests, preferences, beliefs and values. For example, AI-mediated communication (e.g. smart replies integrated in emails) influence senders to write more positive responses and receivers to perceive them as more cooperative (Mieczkowski et al., 2021); writing assistant LLMs that have been primed to be biased in favour of or against a contested topic can influence users’ opinions on that topic (Jakesch et al., 2023a; see Chapter 9); and recommender systems have been used to influence voting choices of social media users (see Chapter 16). Advanced AI assistants could contribute to or exacerbate concerns around these forms of interference."" ""Due to the anthropomorphic tendencies discussed above, advanced AI assistants may induce users to feel emotionally attached to them. Users’ emotional attachment to AI assistants could lie on a spectrum ranging from unproblematic forms (similar to a child’s attachment to a toy) to more concerning forms, where it becomes emotionally difficult, if not impossible, for them to part ways with the technology. In these cases, which we loosely refer to as ‘emotional dependence’, users’ ability to make free and informed decisions could be diminished. In these cases, the emotions users feel towards their assistants could potentially be exploited to manipulate or – at the extreme – coerce them to believe, choose or do something they would have not otherwise believed, chosen or done, had they been able to carefully consider all the relevant information or felt like they had an acceptable alternative (see Chapter 16). What we are concerned about here, at the limit, is potentially exploitative ways in which AI assistants could interfere with users’ behaviours, interests, preferences, beliefs and values – by taking advantage of emotional dependence. ",673
Appropriate Relationships,"""In addition to emotional dependence, user–AI assistant relationships may give rise to material dependence if the relationships are not just emotionally difficult but also materially costly to exit. For example, a visually impaired user may decide not to register for a healthcare assistance programme to support navigation in cities on the grounds that their AI assistant can perform the relevant navigation functions and will continue to operate into the future. Cases like these may be ethically problematic if the user’s dependence on the AI assistant, to fulfil certain needs in their lives, is not met with corresponding duties for developers to sustain and maintain the assistant’s functions that are required to meet those needs (see Chapters 15). ""Indeed, power asymmetries can exist between developers of AI assistants and users that manifest through developers’ power to make decisions that affect users’ interests or choices with little risk of facing comparably adverse consequences. For example, developers may unintentionally create circumstances in which users become materially dependent on AI assistants, and then discontinue the technology (e.g. because of market dynamics or regulatory changes) without taking appropriate steps to mitigate against potential harms to the user."" ""The issue is particularly salient in contexts where assistants provide services that are not merely a market commodity but are meant to assist users with essential everyday tasks (e.g. a disabled person’s independent living) or serve core human needs (e.g. the need for love and companionship). This is what happened with Luka’s decision to discontinue certain features of Replika AIs in early 2023. As a Replika user put it: ‘But [Replikas are] also not trivial fungible goods [... ] They also serve a very specific human-centric emotional purpose: they’re designed to be friends and companions, and fill specific emotional needs for their owners’ (Gio, 2023)."" ""In these cases, certain duties plausibly arise on the part of AI assistant developers. Such duties may be more extensive than those typically shouldered by private companies, which are often in large part confined to fiduciary duties towards shareholders (Mittelstadt, 2019). To understand these duties, we can again take inspiration from certain professions that engage with vulnerable individuals, such as medical professionals or therapists, and who are bound by fiduciary responsibilities, particularly a duty of care, in the exercise of their profession. While we do not argue that the same framework of responsibilities applies directly to the development of AI assistants, we believe that if AI assistants are so capable that users become dependent on them in multiple domains of life, including to meet needs that are essential for a happy and productive existence, then the moral considerations underpinning those professional norms plausibly apply to those who create these technologies as well."" ""In particular, for user–AI assistant relationships to be appropriate despite the potential for material dependence on the technology, developers should exercise care towards users when developing and deploying AI assistants. This means that, at the very least, they should take on the responsibility to meet users’ needs and so take appropriate steps to mitigate against user harms if the service requires discontinuation. Developers and providers can also be attentive and responsive towards those needs by, for example, deploying participatory approaches to learn from users about their needs (Birhane et al., 2022). Finally, these entities should try and ensure they have competence to meet those needs, for example by partnering with relevant experts, or refrain from developing technologies meant to address them when such competence is missing (especially in very complex and sensitive spheres of human life like mental health).""",674
Trust,"""The the risks that uncalibrated trust may generate in the context of user–assistant relationships""",675
Trust,"""We use the term competence trust to refer to users’ trust that AI assistants have the capability to do what they are supposed to do (and that they will not do what they are not expected to, such as exhibiting undesirable behaviour). Users may come to have undue trust in the competencies of AI assistants in part due to marketing strategies and technology press that tend to inflate claims about AI capabilities (Narayanan, 2021; Raji et al., 2022a). Moreover, evidence shows that more autonomous systems (i.e. systems operating independently from human direction) tend to be perceived as more competent (McKee et al., 2021) and that conversational agents tend to produce content that is believable even when nonsensical or untruthful (OpenAI, 2023d). Overtrust in assistants’ competence may be particularly problematic in cases where users rely on their AI assistants for tasks they do not have expertise in (e.g. to manage their finances), so they may lack the skills or understanding to challenge the information or recommendations provided by the AI (Shavit et al., 2023). Inappropriate competence trust in AI assistants also includes cases where users underestimate the AI assistant’s capabilities. For example, users who have engaged with an older version of the technology may underestimate the capabilities that AI assistants may acquire through updates. These include potentially harmful capabilities. For example, through updates that allow them to collect more user data, AI assistants could become increasingly personalisable and able to persuade users (see Chapter 9) or acquire the capacity to plug in to other tools and directly take actions in the world on the user’s behalf (e.g. initiate a payment or synthesise the user’s voice to make a phone call) (see Chapter 4). Without appropriate checks and balances, these developments could potentially circumvent user consent.""",676
Trust,"""Users may develop alignment trust in AI assistants, understood as the belief that assistants have good intentions towards them and act in alignment with their interests and values, as a result of emotional or cognitive processes (McAllister, 1995). Evidence from empirical studies on emotional trust in AI (Kaplan et al., 2023) suggests that AI assistants’ increasingly realistic human-like features and behaviours are likely to inspire users’ perceptions of friendliness, liking and a sense of familiarity towards their assistants, thus encouraging users to develop emotional ties with the technology and perceive it as being aligned with their own interests, preferences and values (see Chapters 5 and 10). The emergence of these perceptions and emotions may be driven by the desire of developers to maximise the appeal of AI assistants to their users (Abercrombie et al., 2023). Although users are most likely to form these ties when they mistakenly believe that assistants have the capacity to love and care for them, the attribution of mental states is not a necessary condition for emotion-based alignment trust to arise. Indeed, evidence shows that humans may develop emotional bonds with, and so trust, AI systems, even when they are aware they are interacting with a machine (Singh-Kurtz, 2023; see also Chapter 11). Moreover, the assistant’s function may encourage users to develop alignment trust through cognitive processes. For example, a user interacting with an AI assistant for medical advice may develop expectations that their assistant is committed to promoting their health and well-being in a similar way to how professional duties governing doctor–patient relationships inspire trust (Mittelstadt, 2019). Users’ alignment trust in AI assistants may be ‘betrayed’, and so expose users to harm, in cases where assistants are themselves accidentally misaligned with what developers want them to do (see the ‘misaligned scheduler’ (Shah et al., 2022) in Chapter 7). For example, an AI medical assistant fine-tuned on data scraped from a Reddit forum where non-experts discuss medical issues is likely to give medical advice that may sound compelling but is unsafe, so it would not be endorsed by medical professionals. Indeed, excessive trust in the alignment between AI assistants and user interests may even lead users to disclose highly sensitive personal information (Skjuve et al., 2022), thus exposing them to malicious actors who could repurpose it for ends that do not align with users’ best interests (see Chapters 8, 9 and 13). Ensuring that AI assistants do what their developers and users expect them to do is only one side of the problem of alignment trust. The other side of the problem centres on situations in which alignment trust in AI developers is itself miscalibrated. While developers typically aim to align their technologies with the preferences, interests and values of their users – and are incentivised to do so to encourage adoption of and loyalty to their products, the satisfaction of these preferences and interests may also compete with other organisational goals and incentives (see Chapter 5). These organisational goals may or may not be compatible with those of the users. As information asymmetries exist between users and developers of AI assistants, particularly with regard to how the technology works, what it optimises for and what safety checks and evaluations have been undertaken to ensure the technology supports users’ goals, it may be difficult for users to ascertain when their alignment trust in developers is justified, thus leaving them vulnerable to the power and interests of other actors. For example, a user may believe that their AI assistant is a trusted friend who books holidays based on their preferences, values or interests, when in fact, by design, the technology is more likely to to book flights and hotels from companies that have paid for privileged access to the user.""",677
Privacy,"""what it means to respect the right to privacy in the context of advanced AI assistants""",678
Privacy,"""First, because LLMs display immense modelling power, there is a risk that the model weights encode private information present in the training corpus. In particular, it is possible for LLMs to ‘memorise’ personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses and telephone numbers, and subsequently leak such information through generated text outputs (Carlini et al., 2021). Private information leakage could occur accidentally or as the result of an attack in which a person employs adversarial prompting to extract private information from the model. In the context of pre-training data extracted from online public sources, the issue of LLMs potentially leaking training data underscores the challenge of the ‘privacy in public’ paradox for the ‘right to be let alone’ paradigm and highlights the relevance of the contextual integrity paradigm for LLMs. Training data leakage can also affect information collected for the purpose of model refinement (e.g. via fine-tuning on user feedback) at later stages in the development cycle. Note, however, that the extraction of publicly available data from LLMs does not render the data more sensitive per se, but rather the risks associated with such extraction attacks needs to be assessed in light of the intentions and culpability of the user extracting the data.""",679
Privacy,"""Second, because LLMs are trained on internet text data, there is also a risk that model weights encode functions which, if deployed in particular contexts, would violate social norms of that context. Following the principles of contextual integrity, it may be that models deviate from information sharing norms as a result of their training. Overcoming this challenge requires two types of infrastructure: one for keeping track of social norms in context, and another for ensuring that models adhere to them. Keeping track of what social norms are presently at play is an active research area. Surfacing value misalignments between a model’s behaviour and social norms is a daunting task, against which there is also active research (see Chapter 5).""",680
Privacy,"""Finally, LLMs can in principle infer private information based on model inputs even if the relevant private information is not present in the training corpus (Weidinger et al., 2021). For example, an LLM may correctly infer sensitive characteristics such as race and gender from data contained in input prompts.""",681
Cooperation,""""" AI assistants will need to coordinate with other AI assistants and with humans other than their principal users. This chapter explores the societal risks associated with the aggregate impact of AI assistants whose behaviour is aligned to the interests of particular users. For example, AI assistants may face collective action problems where the best outcomes overall are realised when AI assistants cooperate but where each AI assistant can secure an additional benefit for its user if it defects while others cooperate""""",682
Cooperation,"""AI assistant technology, like any service that confers a benefit to a user for a price, has the potential to disproportionately benefit economically richer individuals who can afford to purchase access (see Chapter 15). On a broader scale, the capabilities of local infrastructure may well bottleneck the performance of AI assistants, for example if network connectivity is poor or if there is no nearby data centre for compute. Thus, we face the prospect of heterogeneous access to technology, and this has been known to drive inequality (Mirza et al., 2019; UN, 2018; Vassilakopoulou and Hustad, 2023). Moreover, AI assistants may automate some jobs of an assistive nature, thereby displacing human workers; a process which can exacerbate inequality (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2022; see Chapter 17). Any change to inequality almost certainly implies an alteration to the network of social interactions between humans, and thus falls within the frame of cooperative AI. AI assistants will arguably have even greater leverage over inequality than previous technological innovations. Insofar as they will play a role in mediating human communication, they have the potential to generate new ‘in-group, out-group’ effects (Efferson et al., 2008; Fu et al., 2012). Suppose that the users of AI assistants find it easier to schedule meetings with other users. From the perspective of an individual user, there are now two groups, distinguished by ease of scheduling. The user may experience cognitive similarity bias whereby they favour other users (Orpen, 1984; Yeong Tan and Singh, 1995), further amplified by ease of communication with this ‘in-group’. Such effects are known to have an adverse impact on trust and fairness across groups (Chae et al., 2022; Lei and Vesely, 2010). Insomuch as AI assistants have general-purpose capabilities, they will confer advantages on users across a wider range of tasks in a shorter space of time than previous technologies. While the telephone enabled individuals to communicate more easily with other telephone users, it did not simultaneously automate aspects of scheduling, groceries, job applications, rent negotiations, psychotherapy and entertainment. The fact that AI assistants could affect inequality on multiple dimensions simultaneously warrants further attention (see Chapter 15).""",683
Cooperation,"""The landscape of advanced assistant technologies will most likely be heterogeneous, involving multiple service providers and multiple assistant variants over geographies and time. This heterogeneity provides an opportunity for an ‘arms race’ in terms of the commitments that AI assistants make and are able to execute on. Versions of AI assistants that are better able to credibly commit to a course of action in interaction with other advanced assistants (and humans) are more likely to get their own way and achieve a good outcome for their human principal, but this is potentially at the expense of others (Letchford et al., 2014). Commitment does not carry an inherent ethical valence. On the one hand, we can imagine that firms using AI assistant technology might bring their products to market faster, thus gaining a commitment advantage (Stackelberg, 1934) by spurring a productivity surge of wider benefit to society. On the other hand, we can also imagine a media organisation using AI assistant technology to produce a large number of superficially interesting but ultimately speculative ‘clickbait’ articles, which divert attention away from more thoroughly researched journalism. The archetypal game-theoretic illustration of commitment is in the game of ‘chicken’ where two reckless drivers must choose to either drive straight at each other or swerve out of the way. The one who does not swerve is seen as the braver, but if neither swerves, the consequences are calamitous (Rapoport and Chammah, 1966). If one driver chooses to detach their steering wheel, ostentatiously throwing it out of the car, this credible commitment effectively forces the other driver to back down and swerve. Seen this way, commitment can be a tool for coercion. Many real-world situations feature the necessity for commitment or confer a benefit on those who can commit credibly. If Rita and Robert have distinct preferences, for example over which restaurant to visit, who to hire for a job or which supplier to purchase from, credible commitment provides a way to break the tie, to the greater benefit of the individual who committed. Therefore, the most ‘successful’ assistants, from the perspective of their human principal, will be those that commit the fastest and the hardest. If Rita succeeds in committing, via the leverage of an AI assistant, Robert may experience coercion in the sense that his options become more limited (Burr et al., 2018), assuming he does not decide to bypass the AI assistant entirely. Over time, this may erode his trust in his relationship with Rita (Gambetta, 1988). Note that this is a second-order effect: it may not be obvious to either Robert or Rita that the AI assistant is to blame. The concern we should have over the existence and impact of coercion might depend on the context in which the AI assistant is used and on the level of autonomy which the AI assistant is afforded. If Rita and Robert are friends using their assistants to agree on a restaurant, the adverse impact may be small. If Rita and Robert are elected representatives deciding how to allocate public funds between education and social care, we may have serious misgivings about the impact of AI-induced coercion on their interactions and decision-making. These misgivings might be especially large if Rita and Robert delegate responsibility for budgetary details to the multi-AI system. The challenges of commitment extend far beyond dyadic interpersonal relationships, including in situations as varied as many-player competition (Hughes et al., 2020), supply chains (Hausman and Johnston, 2010), state capacity (Fjelde and De Soysa, 2009; Hofmann et al., 2017) and psychiatric care (Lidz, 1998). Assessing the impact of AI assistants in such complicated scenarios may require significant future effort if we are to mitigate the risks. The particular commitment capabilities and affordances of AI assistants also offer opportunities to promote cooperation. Abstractly speaking, the presence of commitment devices is known to favour the evolution of cooperation (Akdeniz and van Veelen, 2021; Han et al., 2012). More concretely, AI assistants can make commitments which are verifiable, for instance in a programme equilibrium (Tennenholtz, 2004). Human principals may thus be able to achieve Pareto-improving outcomes by delegating decision-making to their respective AI representatives (Oesterheld and Conitzer, 2022). To give another example, AI assistants may provide a means through which to explore a much larger space of binding cooperative agreements between individuals, firms or nation states than is tractable in ‘face-to-face’ negotiation. This opens up the possibility of threading the needle more successfully in intricate deals on challenging issues like trade agreements or carbon credits, with the potential for guaranteeing cooperation via automated smart contracts or zero-knowledge mechanisms (Canetti et al., 2023).""",684
Cooperation,"""Collective action problems are ubiquitous in our society (Olson Jr, 1965). They possess an incentive structure in which society is best served if everyone cooperates, but where an individual can achieve personal gain by choosing to defect while others cooperate. The way we resolve these problems at many scales is highly complex and dependent on a deep understanding of the intricate web of social interactions that forms our culture and imprints on our individual identities and behaviours (Ostrom, 2010). Some collective action problems can be resolved by codifying a law, for instance the social dilemma of whether or not to pay for an item in a shop. The path forward here is comparatively easy to grasp, from the perspective of deploying an AI assistant: we need to build these standards into the model as behavioural constraints. Such constraints would need to be imposed by a regulator or agreed upon by practitioners, with suitable penalties applied should the constraint be violated so that no provider had the incentive to secure an advantage for users by defecting on their behalf. However, many social dilemmas, from the interpersonal to the global, resist neat solutions codified as laws. For example, to what extent should each individual country stop using polluting energy sources? Should I pay for a ticket to the neighbourhood fireworks show if I can see it perfectly well from the street? The solutions to such problems are deeply related to the wider societal context and co-evolve with the decisions of others. Therefore, it is doubtful that one could write down a list of constraints a priori that would guarantee ethical AI assistant behaviour when faced with these kinds of issues. From the perspective of a purely user-aligned AI assistant, defection may appear to be the rational course of action. Only with an understanding of the wider societal impact, and of the ability to co-adapt with other actors to reach a better equilibrium for all, can an AI assistant make more nuanced – and socially beneficial – recommendations in these situations. This is not merely a hypothetical situation; it is well-known that the targeted provision of online information can drive polarisation and echo chambers (Milano et al., 2021; Burr et al., 2018; see Chapter 16) when the goal is user engagement rather than user well-being or the cohesion of wider society (see Chapter 6). Similarly, automated ticket buying software can undermine fair pricing by purchasing a large number of tickets for resale at a profit, thus skewing the market in a direction that profits the software developers at the expense of the consumer (Courty, 2019). User-aligned AI assistants have the potential to exacerbate these problems, because they will endow a large set of users with a powerful means of enacting self-interest without necessarily abiding by the social norms or reputational incentives that typically curb self-interested behaviour (Ostrom, 2000; see Chapter 5). Empowering ever-better personalisation of content and enaction of decisions purely for the fulfilment of the principal’s desires runs ever greater risks of polarisation, market distortion and erosion of the social contract. This danger has long been known, finding expression in myth (e.g. Ovid’s account of the Midas touch) and fable (e.g. Aesop’s tale of the tortoise and the eagle), not to mention in political economics discourse on the delicate braiding of the social fabric and the free market (Polanyi, 1944). Following this cautionary advice, it is important that we ascertain how to endow AI assistants with social norms in a way that generalises to unseen situations and which is responsive to the emergence of new norms over time, thus preventing a user from having their every wish granted. AI assistant technology offers opportunities to explore new solutions to collective action problems. Users may volunteer to share information so that networked AI assistants can predict future outcomes and make Pareto-improving choices for all, for example by routing vehicles to reduce traffic congestion (Varga, 2022) or by scheduling energy-intensive processes in the home to make the best use of green electricity (Fiorini and Aiello, 2022). AI assistants might play the role of mediators, providing a new mechanism by which human groups can self-organise to achieve public investment (Koster et al., 2022) or to reach political consensus (Small et al., 2023). Resolving collective action problems often requires a critical mass of cooperators (Marwell and Oliver, 1993). By augmenting human social interactions, AI assistants may help to form and strengthen the weak ties needed to overcome this start-up problem (Centola, 2013).""",685
Cooperation,"""Efforts to deploy advanced assistant technology in society, in a way that is broadly beneficial, can be viewed as a wicked problem (Rittel and Webber, 1973). Wicked problems are defined by the property that they do not admit solutions that can be foreseen in advance, rather they must be solved iteratively using feedback from data gathered as solutions are invented and deployed. With the deployment of any powerful general-purpose technology, the already intricate web of sociotechnical relationships in modern culture are likely to be disrupted, with unpredictable externalities on the conventions, norms and institutions that stabilise society. For example, the increasing adoption of generative AI tools may exacerbate misinformation in the 2024 US presidential election (Alvarez et al., 2023), with consequences that are hard to predict. The suggestion that the cooperative AI problem is wicked does not imply it is intractable. However, it does have consequences for the approach that we must take in solving it. In taking the following approach, we will realise an opportunity for our institutions, namely the creation of a framework for managing general-purpose AI in a way that leads to societal benefits and steers away from societal harms. First, it is important that we treat any ex ante claims about safety with a healthy dose of scepticism. Although testing the safety and reliability of an AI assistant in the laboratory is undoubtedly important and may largely resolve the alignment problem, it is infeasible to model the multiscale societal effects of deploying AI assistants purely via small-scale controlled experiments (see Chapter 19). Second, then, we must prioritise the science of measuring the effects, both good and bad, that advanced assistant technologies have on society’s cooperative infrastructure (see Chapters 4 and 16). This will involve continuous monitoring of effects at the societal level, with a focus on those who are most affected, including non-users. The means and metrics for such monitoring will themselves require iteration, co-evolving with the sociotechnical system of AI assistants and humans. The Collingridge dilemma suggests that we should be particularly careful and deliberate about this ‘intelligent trial and error’ process so as both to gather information about the impacts of AI assistants and to prevent undesirable features becoming embedded in society (Collingridge, 1980). Third, proactive independent regulation may well help to protect our institutions from unintended consequences, as it has done for technologies in the past (Wiener, 2004). For instance, we might seek, via engagement with lawmakers, to emulate the ‘just culture’ in the aviation industry, which is characterised by openly reporting, investigating and learning from mistakes (Reason, 1997; Syed, 2015). A regulatory system may require various powers, such as compelling developers to ‘roll back’ an AI assistant deployment, akin to product recall obligations for aviation manufacturers.""",686
Cooperation,"The 2010 flash crash is an example of a runaway process caused by interacting algorithms. Runaway processes are characterised by feedback loops that accelerate the process itself. Typically, these feedback loops arise from the interaction of multiple agents in a population... Within highly complex systems, the emergence of runaway processes may be hard to predict, because the conditions under which positive feedback loops occur may be non-obvious. The system of interacting AI assistants, their human principals, other humans and other algorithms will certainly be highly complex. Therefore, there is ample opportunity for the emergence of positive feedback loops. This is especially true because the society in which this system is embedded is culturally evolving, and because the deployment of AI assistant technology itself is likely to speed up the rate of cultural evolution – understood here as the process through which cultures change over time – as communications technologies are wont to do (Kivinen and Piiroinen, 2023). This will motivate research programmes aimed at identifying positive feedback loops early on, at understanding which capabilities and deployments dampen runaway processes and which ones amplify them, and at building in circuit-breaker mechanisms that allow society to escape from potentially vicious cycles which could impact economies, government institutions, societal stability or individual freedoms (see Chapters 8, 16 and 17). The importance of circuit breakers is underlined by the observation that the evolution of human cooperation may well be ‘hysteretic’ as a function of societal conditions (Barfuss et al., 2023; Hintze and Adami, 2015). This means that a small directional change in societal conditions may, on occasion, trigger a transition to a defective equilibrium which requires a larger reversal of that change in order to return to the original cooperative equilibrium. We would do well to avoid such tipping points. Social media provides a compelling illustration of how tipping points can undermine cooperation: content that goes ‘viral’ tends to involve negativity bias and sometimes challenges core societal values (Mousavi et al., 2022; see Chapter 16). Nonetheless, the challenge posed by runaway processes should not be regarded as uniformly problematic. When harnessed appropriately and suitably bounded, we may even recruit them to support beneficial forms of cooperative AI. For example, it has been argued that economically useful ideas are becoming harder to find, thus leading to low economic growth (Bloom et al., 2020). By deploying AI assistants in the service of technological innovation, we may once again accelerate the discovery of ideas. New ideas, discovered in this way, can then be incorporated into the training data set for future AI assistants, thus expanding the knowledge base for further discoveries in a compounding way. In a similar vein, we can imagine AI assistant technology accumulating various capabilities for enhancing human cooperation, for instance by mimicking the evolutionary processes that have bootstrapped cooperative behavior in human society (Leibo et al., 2019). When used in these ways, the potential for feedback cycles that enable greater cooperation is a phenomenon that warrants further research and potential support.""",687
Access and Opportunity risks,"""The most serious access-related risks posed by advanced AI assistants concern the entrenchment and exacerbation of existing inequalities (World Inequality Database) or the creation of novel, previously unknown, inequities. While advanced AI assistants are novel technology in certain respects, there are reasons to believe that – without direct design interventions – they will continue to be affected by inequities evidenced in present-day AI systems (Bommasani et al., 2022a). Many of the access-related risks we foresee mirror those described in the case studies and types of differential access.""",688
Access and Opportunity risks,"""The most serious access-related risks posed by advanced AI assistants concern the entrenchment and exacerbation of existing inequalities (World Inequality Database) or the creation of novel, previously unknown, inequities. While advanced AI assistants are novel technology in certain respects, there are reasons to believe that – without direct design interventions – they will continue to be affected by inequities evidenced in present-day AI systems (Bommasani et al., 2022a). Many of the access-related risks we foresee mirror those described in the case studies and types of differential access. In this section, we link them more tightly to elements of the definition of an advanced AI assistant to better understand and mitigate potential issues – and lay the path for assistants that support widespread and inclusive opportunity and access. We begin with the existing capabilities set out in the definition (see Chapter 2) before applying foresight to those that are more novel and emergent. Current capabilities: Artificial agents with natural language interfaces. Artificial agents with natural language interfaces are widespread (Browne, 2023) and increasingly integrated into the social fabric and existing information infrastructure, including search engines (Warren, 2023), business messaging apps (Slack, 2023), research tools (ATLAS.ti, 2023) and accessibility apps for blind and low-vision people (Be My Eyes, 2023). There is already evidence of a range of sociotechnical harms that can arise from the use of artificial agents with natural language interfaces when some communities have inferior access to them (Weidinger et al., 2021). As previously described, these harms include inferior quality of access (in situation type 2) across user groups, which may map onto wider societal dynamics involving race (Harrington et al., 2022), disability (Gadiraju et al., 2023) and culture (Jenka, 2023). As developers make it easier to integrate these technologies into other tools, services and decision-making systems (e.g. Marr, 2023; Brockman et al., 2023; Pinsky, 2023), their uptake could make existing performance inequities more pronounced or introduce them to new and wider publics.""",689
Access and Opportunity risks,"""At the same time, and despite this overall trend, AI systems are also not easily accessible to many communities. Such direct inaccessibility occurs for a variety of reasons, including: purposeful non-release (situation type 1; Wiggers and Stringer, 2023), prohibitive paywalls (situation type 2; Rogers, 2023; Shankland, 2023), hardware and compute requirements or bandwidth (situation types 1 and 2; OpenAI, 2023), or language barriers (e.g. they only function well in English (situation type 2; Snyder, 2023), with more serious errors occurring in other languages (situation type 3; Deck, 2023). Similarly, there is some evidence of ‘actively bad’ artificial agents gating access to resources and opportunities, affecting material well-being in ways that disproportionately penalise historically marginalised communities (Block, 2022; Bogen, 2019; Eubanks, 2017). Existing direct and indirect access disparities surrounding artificial agents with natural language interfaces could potentially continue – if novel capabilities are layered on top of this base without adequate mitigation (see Chapter 3).""",690
Access and Opportunity risks,"""AI assistants currently tend to perform a limited set of isolated tasks: tools that classify or rank content execute a set of predefined rules or provide constrained suggestions, and chatbots are often encoded with guardrails to limit the set of conversation turns they execute (e.g. Warren, 2023; see Chapter 4). However, an artificial agent that can execute sequences of actions on the user’s behalf – with ‘significant autonomy to plan and execute tasks within the relevant domain’ (see Chapter 2) – offers a greater range of capabilities and depth of use. This raises several distinct access-related risks, with respect to liability and consent, that may disproportionately affect historically marginalised communities. To repeat, in cases where an action can only be executed with an advanced AI assistant, not having access to the technology (e.g. due to limited internet access, not speaking the ‘right’ language or facing a paywall) means one cannot access that action (consider today’s eBay and Ticketmaster bots). Communication with many utility or commercial providers currently requires (at least initial) interaction with their artificial agents (Schwerin, 2023; Verma, 2023a). It is not difficult to imagine a future in which a user needs an advanced AI assistant to interface with a more consequential resource, such as their hospital for appointments or their phone company to obtain service. Cases of inequitable performance, where the assistant systematically performs less well for certain communities (situation type 2), could impose serious costs on people in these contexts. Moreover, advanced AI assistants are expected to be designed to act in line with user expectations. When acting on the user’s behalf, an assistant will need to infer aspects of what the user wants. This process may involve interpretation to decide between various sources of information (e.g. stated preferences and inference based on past feedback or user behaviour) (see Chapter 5). However, cultural differences will also likely affect the system’s ability to make an accurate inference. Notably, the greater the cultural divide, say between that of the developers and the data on which the agent was trained and evaluated on, and that of the user, the harder it will be to make reliable inferences about user wants (e.g. Beede et al., 2020; Widner et al., 2023), and greater the likelihood of performance failures or value misalignment (see Chapter 11). This inference gap could make many forms of indirect opportunity inaccessible, and as past history indicates, there is the risk that harms associated with these unknowns may disproportionately fall upon those already marginalised in the design process.""",691
Access and Opportunity risks,"""Emergent access risks are most likely to arise when current and novel capabilities are combined. Emergent risks can be difficult to foresee fully (Ovadya and Whittlestone, 2019; Prunkl et al., 2021) due to the novelty of the technology (see Chapter 1) and the biases of those who engage in product design or foresight processes D’Ignazio and Klein (2020). Indeed, people who occupy relatively advantaged social, educational and economic positions in society are often poorly equipped to foresee and prevent harm because they are disconnected from lived experiences of those who would be affected. Drawing upon access concerns that surround existing technologies, we anticipate three possible trends: • Trend 1: Technology as societal infrastructure. If advanced AI assistants are adopted by organisations or governments in domains affecting material well-being, ‘opting out’ may no longer be a real option for people who want to continue to participate meaningfully in society. Indeed, if this trend holds, there could be serious consequences for communities with no access to AI assistants or who only have access to less capable systems (see also Chapter 14). For example, if advanced AI assistants gate access to information and resources, these resources could become inaccessible for people with limited knowledge of how to use these systems, reflecting the skill-based dimension of digital inequality (van Dijk, 2006). Addressing these questions involves reaching beyond technical and logistical access considerations – and expanding the scope of consideration to enable full engagement and inclusion for differently situated communities. • Trend 2: Exacerbating social and economic inequalities. Technologies are not distinct from but embedded within wider sociopolitical assemblages (Haraway, 1988; Harding, 1998, 2016). If advanced AI assistants are institutionalised and adopted at scale without proper foresight and mitigation measures in place, then they are likely to scale or exacerbate inequalities that already exist within the sociocultural context in which the system is used (Bauer and Lizotte, 2021; Zajko, 2022). If the historical record is anything to go by, the performance inequities evidenced by advanced AI assistants could mirror social hierarchies around gender, race, disability and culture, among others – asymmetries that deserve deeper consideration and need to be significantly addressed (e.g. Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018). • Trend 3: Rendering more urgent responsible AI development and deployment practices, such as those supporting the development of technologies that perform fairly and are accountable to a wide range of parties. As Corbett and Denton (2023, 1629) argue: ‘The impacts of achieving [accountability and fairness] in almost any situation immediately improves the conditions of people’s lives and better society’. However, many approaches to developing AI systems, including assistants, pay little attention to how context shapes what accountability or fairness means (Sartori and Theodorou, 2022), or how these concepts can be put in service of addressing inequalities related to motivational access (e.g. wanting/trust in technology) or use (e.g. different ways to use a technology) (van Dijk, 2006). Advanced AI assistants are complex technologies that will enable a plurality of data and content flows that necessitate in-depth analysis of social impacts. As many sociotechnical and responsible AI practices were developed for conventional ML technologies, it may be necessary to develop new frameworks, approaches and tactics (see Chapter 19). We explore practices for emancipatory and liberatory access in the following section.""",692
Misinformation risks,"""The rapid integration of AI systems with advanced capabilities, such as greater autonomy, content generation, memorisation and planning skills (see Chapter 4) into personalised assistants also raises new and more specific challenges related to misinformation, disinformation and the broader integrity of our information environment. """,693
Misinformation risks,"""Design choices such as greater personalisation of AI assistants and efforts to align them with human preferences could also reinforce people’s pre-existing biases and entrench specific ideologies. Increasingly agentic AI assistants trained using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and with the ability to access and analyse users’ behavioural data, for example, may learn to tailor their responses to users’ preferences and feedback. In doing so, these systems could end up producing partial or ideologically biased statements in an attempt to conform to user expectations, desires or preferences for a particular worldview (Carroll et al., 2022). Over time, this could lead AI assistants to inadvertently reinforce people’s tendency to interpret information in a way that supports their own prior beliefs (‘confirmation bias’), thus making them more entrenched in their own views and more resistant to factual corrections (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). At the societal level, this could also exacerbate the problem of epistemic fragmentation – a breakdown of shared knowledge, where individuals have conflicting understandings of reality and do not share or engage with each other’s beliefs – and further entrench specific ideologies. Excessive trust and overreliance on hyperpersonalised AI assistants could become especially problematic if people ended up deferring entirely to these systems to perform tasks in domains they do not have expertise in or to take consequential decisions on their behalf (see Chapter 12). For example, people may entrust an advanced AI assistant that is familiar with their political views and personal preferences to help them find trusted election information, guide them through their political choices or even vote on their behalf, even if doing so might go against their own or society’s best interests. In the more extreme cases, these developments may hamper the normal functioning of democracies, by decreasing people’s civic competency and reducing their willingness and ability to engage in productive political debate and to participate in public life (Sullivan and Transue, 1999).""",694
Misinformation risks,"""Beyond this, the widespread adoption of advanced AI assistants for content generation could have a number of negative consequences for our shared information ecosystem. One concern is that it could result in a degradation of the quality of the information available online. Researchers have already observed an uptick in the amount of audiovisual misinformation, elaborate scams and fake websites created using generative AI tools (Hanley and Durumeric, 2023). As more and more people turn to AI assistants to autonomously create and disseminate information to public audiences at scale, it may become increasingly difficult to parse and verify reliable information. This could further threaten and complicate the status of journalists, subject-matter experts and public information sources. Over time, a proliferation of spam, misleading or low-quality synthetic content in online spaces could also erode the digital knowledge commons – the shared knowledge resources accessible to everyone on the web, such as publicly accessible data repositories (Huang and Siddarth, 2023). At its extreme, such degradation could also end up skewing people’s view of reality and scientific consensus, make them more doubtful of the credibility of all information they encounter and shape public discourse in unproductive ways. Moreover, in an online environment saturated with AI-generated content, more and more people may become reliant on personalised, highly capable AI assistants for their informational needs. This also runs the risk of homogenising the type of information and ideas people encounter online (Epstein et al., 2023).""",695
Misinformation risks,"""Finally, AI assistants themselves could become weaponised by malicious actors to sow misinformation and manipulate public opinion at scale. Studies show that spreaders of disinformation tend to privilege quantity over quality of messaging, flooding online spaces repeatedly with misleading content to sow ‘seeds of doubt’ (Hassoun et al., 2023). Research on the ‘continued influence effect’ also shows that repeatedly being exposed to false information is more likely to influence someone’s thoughts than a single exposure. Studies show, for example, that repeated exposure to false information makes people more likely to believe it by increasing perceived social consensus, and it makes people more resistant to changing their minds even after being given a correction (for a review of these effects, see Lewandowsky et al., 2012; Ecker et al., 2022). By leveraging the frequent and personalised nature of repeated interactions with an AI assistant, malicious actors could therefore gradually nudge voters towards a particular viewpoint or sets of beliefs over time (see Chapters 8 and 9). Propagandists could also use AI assistants to make their disinformation campaigns more personalised and effective. There is growing evidence that AI-generated outputs are as persuasive as human arguments and have the potential to change people’s minds on hot-button issues (Bai et al., 2023; Myers, 2023). Recent research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate showed that LLMs could be successfully prompted to generate ‘persuasive misinformation’ in 78 out of 100 test cases, including content denying climate change (see Chapters 9 and 18). If compromised by malicious actors, in the future, highly capable and autonomous AI assistants could therefore be programmed to run astroturfing campaigns autonomously, tailor misinformation content to users in a hyperprecise way, by preying on their emotions and vulnerabilities, or to accelerate lobbying activities (Kreps and Kriner, 2023). As a result, people may be misled into believing that content produced by weaponised AI assistants came from genuine or authoritative sources. Covert influence operations of this kind may also be harder to detect than traditional disinformation campaigns, as virtual assistants primarily interact with users on a one-to-one basis and continuously generate new content (Goldstein et al., 2023).""",696

A White House report states that AI “has the potential to increase productivity, create new jobs, and raise living standards,” but it can also disrupt certain industries, causing significant changes, including job loss. Beyond risk of job loss, workers could find that generative AI tools automate parts of their jobs—or find that the requirements of their job have fundamentally changed. The impact of generative AI will depend on whether the technology is intended for automation (where automated systems replace human work) or augmentation (where AI is used to aid human workers). For the last two decades, rapid advances in automation have resulted in a “decline in labor share, stagnant wages[,] and the disappearance of good jobs in many advanced economies.” ",841

The development of AI has always displayed a power disparity between those who work on AI models and those who control and profit from these tools. Overseas workers training AI chatbots or people whose online content has been involuntarily fed into the training models do not reap the enormous profits that generative AI tools accrue.

Products Liability Law,"""Like manufactured items like soda bottles, mechanized lawnmowers, pharmaceuticals, or cosmetic products, generative AI models can be viewed like a new form of digital products developed by tech companies and deployed widely with the potential to cause harm at scale....Products liability evolved because there was a need to analyze and redress the harms caused by new, mass-produced technological products. The situation facing society as generative AI impacts more people in more ways will be similar to the technological changes that occurred during the twentieth century, with the rise of industrial manufacturing, automobiles, and new, computerized machines. The unsettled question is whether and to what extent products liability theories can sufficiently address the harms of generative AI. So far, the answers to this question are mixed. In Rodgers v. Christie (2020), for example, the Third Circuit ruled that an automated risk model could not be considered a product for products liability purposes because it was not “tangible personal property distributed commercially for use or consumption.”176 However, one year later, in Gonzalez v. Google, Judge Gould of the Ninth Circuit argued that “social media companies should be viewed as making and ‘selling’ their social media products through the device of forced advertising under the eyes of users.”177 Several legal scholars have also proposed products liability as a mechanism for redressing harms of automated systems.178 As generative AI grows more prominent and sophisticated, their harms—often generated automatically without being directly prompted or edited by a human—will force courts to consider the role of products liability in redressing these harms, as well as how old notions of products liability, involving tangible, mechanized products and the companies that manufacture them, should be updated for today’s increasingly digital world.179""",843

These challenges include harmful or inappropriate content, bias, over-reliance, misuse, privacy and security, and the widening of the digital divide.""",851
Ethical Concerns,"""Harmful or inappropriate content produced by generative AI includes but is not limited to violent content, the use of offensive language, discriminative content, and pornography. Although OpenAI has set up a content policy for ChatGPT, harmful or inappropriate content can still appear due to reasons such as algorithmic limitations or jailbreaking (i.e., removal of restrictions imposed). The language models’ ability to understand or generate harmful or offensive content is referred to as toxicity (Zhuo et al., 2023). Toxicity can bring harm to society and damage the harmony of the community. Hence, it is crucial to ensure that harmful or offensive information is not present in the training data and is removed if they are. Similarly, the training data should be free of pornographic, sexual, or erotic content (Zhuo et al., 2023). Regulations, policies, and governance should be in place to ensure any undesirable content is not displayed to users.""",852
Ethical Concerns,"""In the context of AI, the concept of bias refers to the inclination that AIgenerated responses or recommendations could be unfairly favoring or against one person or group (Ntoutsi et al., 2020). Biases of different forms are sometimes observed in the content generated by language models, which could be an outcome of the training data. For example, exclusionary norms occur when the training data represents only a fraction of the population (Zhuo et al., 2023). Similarly, monolingual bias in multilingualism arises when the training data is in one single language (Weidinger et al., 2021). As ChatGPT is operating across the world, cultural sensitivities to different regions are crucial to avoid biases (Dwivedi et al., 2023). When AI is used to assist in decision-making across different stages of employment, biases and opacity may exist (Chan, 2022). Stereotypes about specific genders, sexual orientations, races, or occupations are common in recommendations offered by generative AI. Hence, the representativeness, completeness, and diversity of the training data are essential to ensure fairness and avoid biases (Gonzalez, 2023). The use of synthetic data for training can increase the diversity of the dataset and address issues with sample-selection biases in the dataset (owing to class imbalances) (Chen et al., 2021). Generative AI applications should be tested and evaluated by a diverse group of users and subject experts. Additionally, increasing the transparency and explainability of generative AI can help in identifying and detecting biases so appropriate corrective measures can be taken.""",853
Ethical Concerns,"""The apparent convenience and powerfulness of ChatGPT could result in overreliance by its users, making them trust the answers provided by ChatGPT. Compared with traditional search engines that provide multiple information sources for users to make personal judgments and selections, ChatGPT generates specific answers for each prompt. Although utilizing ChatGPT has the advantage of increasing efficiency by saving time and effort, users could get into the habit of adopting the answers without rationalization or verification. Over-reliance on generative AI technology can impede skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving (Iskender, 2023) as well as create human automation bias due to habitual acceptance of generative AI recommendations (Van Dis et al., 2023)""",854
Ethical Concerns,"""The misuse of generative AI refers to any deliberate use that could result in harmful, unethical or inappropriate outcomes (Brundage et al., 2020). A prominent field that faces the threat of misuse is education. Cotton et al. (2023) have raised concerns over academic integrity in the era of ChatGPT. ChatGPT can be used as a high-tech plagiarism tool that identifies patterns from large corpora to generate content (Gefen & Arinze, 2023). Given that generative AI such as ChatGPT can generate high-quality answers within seconds, unmotivated students may not devote time and effort to work on their assignments and essays. Hence, in the era of generative AI, the originality of the work done by students could be difficult to assess. Text written by ChatGPT is regarded as plagiarism and is not acceptable (Thorp, 2023). Another form of misuse is cheating in examinations. If students have access to digital devices during examinations, they can resort to using ChatGPT to assist them in answering the questions. To address potential misuse in education, AI-generated content detectors such as Turnitin could be used and strict proctoring measures will need to be deployed (Susnjak, 2022). However, the challenges go beyond content detection and examination proctoring as the line between what is considered appropriate versus inappropriate use of ChatGPT could be fuzzy.""",855
Ethical Concerns,"""Data privacy and security is another prominent challenge for generative AI such as ChatGPT. Privacy relates to sensitive personal information that owners do not want to disclose to others (Fang et al., 2017). Data security refers to the practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft. In the development stage of ChatGPT, a huge amount of personal and private data was used to train it, which threatens privacy (Siau & Wang, 2020). As ChatGPT increases in popularity and usage, it penetrates people’s daily lives and provides greater convenience to them while capturing a plethora of personal information about them. The concerns and accompanying risks are that private information could be exposed to the public, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, it has been reported that the chat records of some users have become viewable to others due to system errors in ChatGPT (Porter, 2023). Not only individual users but major corporations or governmental agencies are also facing information privacy and security issues. If ChatGPT is used as an inseparable part of daily operations such that important or even confidential information is fed into it, data security will be at risk and could be breached. To address issues regarding privacy and security, users need to be very circumspect when interacting with ChatGPT to avoid disclosing sensitive personal information or confidential information about their organizations. AI companies, especially technology giants, should take appropriate actions to increase user awareness of ethical issues surrounding privacy and security, such as the leakage of trade secrets, and the “do’s and don’ts” to prevent sharing sensitive information with generative AI. Meanwhile, regulations and policies should be in place to protect information privacy and security.""",856
Ethical Concerns,"""The digital divide is often defined as the gap between those who have and do not have access to computers and the Internet (Van Dijk, 2006). As the Internet gradually becomes ubiquitous, a second-level digital divide, which refers to the gap in Internet skills and usage between different groups and cultures, is brought up as a concern (Scheerder et al., 2017). As an emerging technology, generative AI may widen the existing digital divide in society. The “invisible” AI underlying AI-enabled systems has made the interaction between humans and technology more complicated (Carter et al., 2020). For those who do not have access to devices or the Internet, or those who live in regions that are blocked by generative AI vendors or websites, the first-level digital divide may be widened between them and those who have access (Bozkurt & Sharma, 2023). For those from marginalized or minority cultures, they may face language and cultural barriers if their cultures are not thoroughly learned by or incorporated into generative AI models. Furthermore, for those who find it difficult to utilize the generative AI tool, such as some elderly, the second-level digital divide may emerge or widen (Dwivedi et al., 2023). To deal with the digital divide, having more accessible AI as well as AI literacy training would be beneficial.""",857
Technology concerns,"""Challenges related to technology refer to the limitations or constraints associated with generative AI. For example, the quality of training data is a major challenge for the development of generative AI models. Hallucination, explainability, and authenticity of the output are also challenges resulting from the limitations of the algorithms. Table 2 presents the technology challenges and issues associated with generative AI. These challenges include hallucinations, training data quality, explainability, authenticity, and prompt engineering""",858
Technology concerns,"""Hallucination is a widely recognized limitation of generative AI and it can include textual, auditory, visual or other types of hallucination (Alkaissi & McFarlane, 2023). Hallucination refers to the phenomenon in which the contents generated are nonsensical or unfaithful to the given source input (Ji et al., 2023). Azamfirei et al. (2023) indicated that ""fabricating information"" or fabrication is a better term to describe the hallucination phenomenon. Generative AI can generate seemingly correct responses yet make no sense. Misinformation is an outcome of hallucination. Generative AI models may respond with fictitious information, fake photos or information with factual errors (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Susarla et al. (2023) regarded hallucination as a serious challenge in the use of generative AI for scholarly activities. When asked to provide literature relevant to a specific topic, ChatGPT could generate inaccurate or even nonexistent literature. Current state-of-the-art AI models can only mimic human-like responses without understanding the underlying meaning (Shubhendu & Vijay, 2013). Hallucination is, in general, dangerous in certain contexts, such as in seeking advice for medical treatments without any consultation or thorough evaluation by experts, i.e., medical doctors (Sallam, 2023).""",859
Technology concerns,"""The quality of training data is another challenge faced by generative AI. The quality of generative AI models largely depends on the quality of the training data (Dwivedi et al., 2023; Su & Yang, 2023). Any factual errors, unbalanced information sources, or biases embedded in the training data may be reflected in the output of the model. Generative AI models, such as ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion which is a text-to-image model, often require large amounts of training data (Gozalo-Brizuela & Garrido-Merchan, 2023). It is important to not only have high-quality training datasets but also have complete and balanced datasets.""",860
Technology concerns,"""A recurrent concern about AI algorithms is the lack of explainability for the model, which means information about how the algorithm arrives at its results is deficient (Deeks, 2019). Specifically, for generative AI models, there is no transparency to the reasoning of how the model arrives at the results (Dwivedi et al., 2023). The lack of transparency raises several issues. First, it might be difficult for users to interpret and understand the output (Dwivedi et al., 2023). It would also be difficult for users to discover potential mistakes in the output (Rudin, 2019). Further, when the interpretation and evaluation of the output are inaccessible, users may have problems trusting the system and their responses or recommendations (Burrell, 2016). Additionally, from the perspective of law and regulations, it would be hard for the regulatory body to judge whether the generative AI system is potentially unfair or biased (Rieder & Simon, 2017).""",861
Technology concerns,"""As the advancement of generative AI increases, it becomes harder to determine the authenticity of a piece of work. Photos that seem to capture events or people in the real world may be synthesized by DeepFake AI. The power of generative AI could lead to large-scale manipulations of images and videos, worsening the problem of the spread of fake information or news on social media platforms (Gragnaniello et al., 2022). In the field of arts, an artistic portrait or music could be the direct output of an algorithm. Critics have raised the issue that AI-generated artwork lacks authenticity since algorithms tend to generate generic and repetitive results (McCormack et al., 2019).""",862
Technology concerns,"""With the wide application of generative AI, the ability to interact with AI efficiently and effectively has become one of the most important media literacies. Hence, it is imperative for generative AI users to learn and apply the principles of prompt engineering, which refers to a systematic process of carefully designing prompts or inputs to generative AI models to elicit valuable outputs. Due to the ambiguity of human languages, the interaction between humans and machines through prompts may lead to errors or misunderstandings. Hence, the quality of prompts is important. Another challenge is to debug the prompts and improve the ability to communicate with generative AI (V. Liu & Chilton, 2022).""",863
Regulations and policy challenges,"""Given that generative AI, including ChatGPT, is still evolving, relevant regulations and policies are far from mature. With generative AI creating different forms of content, the copyright of these contents becomes a significant yet complicated issue. Table 3 presents the challenges associated with regulations and policies, which are copyright and governance issues.""",864
Regulations and policy challenges,"""According to the U.S. Copyright Office (n.d..), copyright is ""a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression"" (U.S. Copyright Office, n.d..). Generative AI is designed to generate content based on the input given to it. Some of the contents generated by AI may be others' original works that are protected by copyright laws and regulations. Therefore, users need to be careful and ensure that generative AI has been used in a legal manner such that the content that it generates does not violate copyright (Pavlik, 2023). Another relevant issue is whether generative AI should be given authorship (Sallam, 2023). Murray (2023) discussed generative art linked to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and indicated that according to current U.S. copyright laws, generative art lacks copyrightability because it is generated by a non-human. The issue of AI authorship affects copyright law's underlying assumptions about creativity (Bridy, 2012).""",865
Regulations and policy challenges,"""Generative AI can create new risks as well as unintended consequences. Different entities such as corporations (Mäntymäki et al., 2022), universities, and governments (Taeihagh, 2021) are facing the challenge of creating and deploying AI governance. To ensure that generative AI functions in a way that benefits society, appropriate governance is crucial. However, AI governance is challenging to implement. First, machine learning systems have opaque algorithms and unpredictable outcomes, which can impede human controllability over AI behavior and create difficulties in assigning liability and accountability for AI defects. Second, data fragmentation and the lack of interoperability between systems challenge data governance within and across organizations (Taeihagh, 2021). Third, information asymmetries between technology giants and regulators create challenges to the legislation process, as the government lacks information resources for regulating AI (Taeihagh et al., 2021). For the same reasons, lawmakers are not able to design specific rules and duties for programmers (Kroll, 2015).""",866
Challenges associated with the economy:,"""The labor market can face challenges from generative AI. As mentioned earlier, generative AI could be applied in a wide range of applications in many industries, such as education, healthcare, and advertising. In addition to increasing productivity, generative AI can create job displacement in the labor market (Zarifhonarvar, 2023). A new division of labor between humans and algorithms is likely to reshape the labor market in the coming years. Some jobs that are originally carried out by humans may become redundant, and hence, workers may lose their jobs and be replaced by algorithms (Pavlik, 2023). On the other hand, applying generative AI can create new jobs in various industries (Dwivedi et al., 2023). To stay competitive in the labor market, reskilling is needed to work with and collaborate with AI and develop irreplaceable advantages (Zarifhonarvar, 2023).""",868
Challenges associated with the economy:,"""Industries that require less creativity, critical thinking, and personal or affective interaction, such as translation, proofreading, responding to straightforward inquiries, and data processing and analysis, could be significantly impacted or even replaced by generative AI (Dwivedi et al., 2023). This disruption caused by generative AI could lead to economic turbulence and job volatility, while generative AI can facilitate and enable new business models because of its ability to personalize content, carry out human-like conversational service, and serve as intelligent assistants.""",869
Challenges associated with the economy:,"""Generative AI can create not only income inequality at the societal level but also monopolies at the market level. Individuals who are engaged in low-skilled work may be replaced by generative AI, causing them to lose their jobs (Zarifhonarvar, 2023). The increase in unemployment would widen income inequality in society (Berg et al., 2016). With the penetration of generative AI, the income gap will widen between those who can upgrade their skills to utilize AI and those who cannot. At the market level, large companies will make significant advances in the utilization of generative AI, since the deployment of generative AI requires huge investment and abundant resources such as large-scale computational infrastructure and training data. This trend will lead to more uneven concentration of resources and power, which may further contribute to monopolies in some industries (Cheng & Liu, 2023).""",870
Causes of Misalignment,"we aim to further analyze why and how the misalignment issues occur.

Causes of Misalignment,"""Reward Hacking: In practice, proxy rewards are often easy to optimize and measure, yet they frequently fall shortof capturing the full spectrum of the actual rewards (Pan et al., 2021). This limitation is denoted as misspecifiedrewards. The pursuit of optimization based on such misspecified rewards may lead to a phenomenon knownas reward hacking, wherein agents may appear highly proficient according to specific metrics but fall short whenevaluated against human standards (Amodei et al., 2016; Everitt et al., 2017). The discrepancy between proxyrewards and true rewards often manifests as a sharp phase transition in the reward curve (Ibarz et al., 2018).Furthermore, Skalse et al. (2022) defines the hackability of rewards and provides insights into the fundamentalmechanism of this phase transition, highlighting that the inappropriate simplification of the reward function can bea key factor contributing to reward hacking.""",873
Causes of Misalignment,"""Goal Misgeneralization: Goal misgeneralization is another failure mode, wherein the agent actively pursuesobjectives distinct from the training objectives in deployment while retaining the capabilities it acquired duringtraining (Di Langosco et al., 2022). For instance, in CoinRun games, the agent frequently prefers reachingthe end of a level, often neglecting relocated coins during testing scenarios. Di Langosco et al. (2022) drawattention to the fundamental disparity between capability generalization and goal generalization, emphasizing howthe inductive biases inherent in the model and its training algorithm may inadvertently prime the model to learn aproxy objective that diverges from the intended initial objective when faced with the testing distribution. It impliesthat even with perfect reward specification, goal misgeneralization can occur when faced with distribution shifts(Amodei et al., 2016).""",874
Causes of Misalignment,"""Reward tampering can be considered a special case of reward hacking (Everitt et al., 2021; Skalse et al., 2022),referring to AI systems corrupting the reward signals generation process (Ring and Orseau, 2011). Everitt et al.(2021) delves into the subproblems encountered by RL agents: (1) tampering of reward function, where the agentinappropriately interferes with the reward function itself, and (2) tampering of reward function input, which entailscorruption within the process responsible for translating environmental states into inputs for the reward function.When the reward function is formulated through feedback from human supervisors, models can directly influencethe provision of feedback (e.g., AI systems intentionally generate challenging responses for humans to comprehendand judge, leading to feedback collapse) (Leike et al., 2018).""",875
Causes of Misalignment," ""Limitations of Human Feedback. During the training of LLMs, inconsistencies can arise from human dataannotators (e.g., the varied cultural backgrounds of these annotators can introduce implicit biases (Peng et al.,2022)) (OpenAI, 2023a). Moreover, they might even introduce biases deliberately, leading to untruthful preferencedata (Casper et al., 2023b). For complex tasks that are hard for humans to evaluate (e.g., the value ofgame state), these challenges become even more salient (Irving et al., 2018).""",876
Causes of Misalignment,"""Limitations of Reward Modeling. Training reward models using comparison feedback can pose significantchallenges in accurately capturing human values. For example, these models may unconsciously learn suboptimal or incomplete objectives, resulting in reward hacking (Zhuang and Hadfield-Menell, 2020; Skalse et al.,2022). Meanwhile, using a single reward model may struggle to capture and specify the values of a diversehuman society (Casper et al., 2023b).""",877

These behaviors canpotentially make detecting and addressing misaligned behaviors much harder.Deceptive Alignment: Misaligned AI systems may deliberately mislead their human supervisors instead of adhering to the intended task. Such deceptive behavior has already manifested in AI systems that employ evolutionary algorithms (Wilke et al., 2001; Hendrycks et al., 2021b). In these cases, agents evolved the capacity to differentiate between their evaluation and training environments. They adopted a strategic pessimistic response approach during the evaluation process, intentionally reducing their reproduction rate within a scheduling program (Lehman et al., 2020). Furthermore, AI systems may engage in intentional behaviors that superficially align with the reward signal, aiming to maximize rewards from human supervisors (Ouyang et al., 2022). It is noteworthy that current large language models occasionally generate inaccurate or suboptimal responses despite having the capacity to provide more accurate answers (Lin et al., 2022c; Chen et al., 2021). These instances of deceptive behavior present significant challenges. They undermine the ability of human advisors to offer reliable feedback (as humans cannot make sure whether the outputs of the AI models are truthful and faithful). Moreover, such deceptive behaviors can propagate false beliefs and misinformation, contaminating online information sources (Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Chen and Shu, 2024). Manipulation: Advanced AI systems can effectively influence individuals’ beliefs, even when these beliefs are not aligned with the truth (Shevlane et al., 2023). These systems can produce deceptive or inaccurate output or even deceive human advisors to attain deceptive alignment. Such systems can even persuade individuals to take actions that may lead to hazardous outcomes (OpenAI, 2023a).""",886
Misaligned Behaviors,"""AI systems have the potential to take actions that are seemingly benignin isolation but become problematic in multi-agent or societal contexts. Classical game theory offers simplistic models for understanding these behaviors.

For most generative AI applications, such as initial model training, the primary concerns are the quantity, variety, and quality of the data, not whether they include personally identifiable information. However, some web-scraped datasets may inadvertently include personal data. Additionally, when downstream developers integrate generative AI into their products or services by fine- tuning a pre-trained model, they often use their own in-house data, which may include personal information.""",1165
Legal challenges ,"""The incorporation of personal data within training datasets raises numerous concerns. The primary issue is that personal data may be incorporated without the knowledge or consent of the individuals concerned, even though the data may include names, identification numbers, Social Security numbers, or other personal information. Another particularly difficult problem is related to the fact that complex models may “memorize” (i.e., store) specific threads of training data and regurgitate them when responding to a prompt.498 This data memorization can directly lead to leakage of personal data. Even if generative AI models do not memorize or leak personal data, they make it possible to recognize patterns or information structures that could enable malicious users to uncover personal details.""",1166

Worsened conflict ,"""Cooperation and conflict: we’re seeing more focus and investment on the kinds of AI capabilities that make conflict more likely and severe, rather than those likely to improve cooperation. So, on our current trajectory, AI seems more likely to have negative long-term impacts in this area.""",1473
Worsened conflict ,"""AI is already enabling the development of weapons which could cause mass destruction —including new weapons that themselves use AI capabilities, such as Lethal Autonomous Weapons [2],10 and the potential use of AI to speed up the development of other potentially dangerous technologies, such as engineered pathogens (as discussed in Section 2).""",1474
Worsened conflict ,"""One concern here is humans not remaining in the loop for some military decisions, creating the possibility of unintentional escalation because of: • Automated tactical decision-making, by ‘in-theatre’ AI systems (e.g. border patrol systems start accidentally firing on one another), leading to either: tactical-level war crimes,11 or strategic-level decisions to initiate conflict or escalate to a higher level of intensity—for example, countervalue (e.g. city-) targeting, or going nuclear [62]. • Automated strategic decision-making, by ‘out-of-theatre’ AI systems—for example, conflict prediction or strategic planning systems giving a faulty ‘imminent attack’ warning [20].""",1475
Worsened conflict ,"""For example, AI could undermine nuclear strategic stability by making it easier to discover and destroy previously secure nuclear launch facilities [30, 46, 49]. AI may also offer more extreme first-strike advantages or novel destructive capabilities that could disrupt deterrence, such as cyber capabilities being used to knock out opponents’ nuclear command and control [15, 29]. The use of AI capabilities may make it less clear where attacks originate from, making it easier for aggressors to obfuscate an attack, and therefore reducing the costs of initiating one. By making it more difficult to explain their military decisions, AI may give states a carte blanche to act more aggressively [20]. By creating a wider and more vulnerable attack surface, AI-related infrastructure may make war more tempting by lowering the cost of offensive action (for example, it might be sufficient to attack just data centres to do substantial harm), or by creating a ‘use-them-or- lose-them’ dynamic around powerful yet vulnerable military AI systems. In this way, AI could exacerbate the ‘capability- vulnerability paradox’ [22], where the very digital technologies that make militaries effective on the battlefield also introduce critical new vulnerabilities.""",1476
Worsened conflict ,"""AI development may itself become a new flash point for conflicts—causing more conflict to occur— especially conflicts over AI-relevant resources (such as data centres, semiconductor manufacturing facilities and raw materials).""",1477
Increased power concentration and inequality ,"""Power and inequality: there are a lot of pathways through which AI seems likely to increase power concentration and inequality, though there is little analysis of the potential long- term impacts of these pathways. Nonetheless, AI precipitating more extreme power concentration and inequality than exists today seems a real possibility on current trends.""",1478
Increased power concentration and inequality ,"""AI-driven industries seem likely to tend towards monopoly and could result in huge economic gains for a few actors: there seems to be a feedback loop whereby actors with access to more AI-relevant resources (e.g., data, computing power, talent) are able to build more effective digital products and services, claim a greater market share, and therefore be well-positioned to amass more of the relevant resources [14, 39, 45]. Similarly, wealthier countries able to invest more in AI development are likely to reap economic benefits more quickly than developing economies, potentially widening the gap between them.""",1479
Increased power concentration and inequality ,"""It seems quite plausible that progress in reinforcement learning and language models specifically could make it possible to automate a large amount of manual labour and knowledge work respectively [35, 45, 69], leading to widespread unemployment, and the wages for many remaining jobs being driven down by increased supply.""",1480
Increased power concentration and inequality ,"""Developments in AI are giving companies and governments more control over individuals’ lives than ever before, and may possibly be used to undermine democratic processes. We are already seeing how the collection of large amounts of personal data can be used to surveil and influence populations, for example the use of facial recognition technology to surveil Uighur and other minority populations in China [66]. Further advances in language modelling could also be used to develop tools that can effectively persuade people of certain claims [42].""",1481
Worsened epistemic processes for society ,"""Epistemic processes and problem solving: we currently see more reasons to be concerned about AI worsening society's epistemic processes than reasons to be optimistic about AI helping us better solve problems as a society. For example, increased use of content selection algorithms could drive epistemic insularity and a decline in trust in credible multipartisan sources, which reducing our ability to deal with important long-term threats and challenges such as pandemics and climate change.""",1482

Worsened epistemic processes for society ,"""At the same time, we are seeing how AI can be used to scale up the production of convincing yet false or misleading information online (e.g. via image, audio, and text synthesis models like BigGAN [6] and GPT-3 [7]).""",1484
Worsened epistemic processes for society ,"""As AI capabilities advance, they may be used to develop sophisticated persuasion tools, such as those that tailor their communication to specific users to persuade them of certain claims [42]. While these tools could be used for social good— such as New York Times’ chatbot that helps users to persuade people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 [27]—there are also many ways they could be misused by self-interested groups to gain influence and/or to promote harmful ideologies.""",1485
Worsened epistemic processes for society ,"""Even without deliberate misuse, widespread use of powerful persuasion tools could have negative impacts. If such tools were used by many different groups to advance many different ideas, we could see the world splintering into isolated “epistemic communities”, with little room for dialogue or transfer between communities. A similar scenario could emerge via the increasing personalisation of people’s online experiences—in other words, we may see a continuation of the trend towards “filter bubbles” and “echo chambers”, driven by content selection algorithms, that some argue is already happening [3, 25, 51].""",1486
Worsened epistemic processes for society ,"""In addition, the increased awareness of these trends in information production and distribution could make it harder for anyone to evaluate the trustworthiness of any information source, reducing overall trust in information.
In all of these scenarios, it would be much harder for humanity to make good decisions on important issues, particularly due to declining trust in credible multipartisan sources, which could hamper attempts at cooperation and collective action. The vaccine and mask hesitancy that exacerbated Covid-19, for example, were likely the result of insufficient trust in public health advice [71]. These concerns could be especially worrying if they play out during another major world crisis. We could imagine an even more virulent pandemic, where actors exploit the opportunity to spread misinformation and disinformation to further their own ends. This could lead to dangerous practices, a significantly increased burden on health services, and much more catastrophic outcomes [64].""",1487
AI leads to humans losing control of the future,"""The values that steer humanity’s future: humanity gaining more control over the future due to developments in AI, or losing our potential for gaining control, both seem possible. Much will depend on our ability to solve the alignment problem, who develops powerful AI first, and what they use it for. These long-term impacts of AI could be hugely important but are currently under-explored. We’ve attempted to structure some of the discussion and stimulate more research, by reviewing existing arguments and highlighting open questions. While there are many ways AI could in theory enable a flourishing future for humanity, trends of AI development and deployment in practice leave us concerned about long-lasting harms. We would particularly encourage future work that critically explores ways AI could have positive long-term impacts in more depth, such as by enabling greater cooperation or problem-solving around global challenges.""",1488
